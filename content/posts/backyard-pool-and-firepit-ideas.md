Testing and Evaluation: How do you go about testing an invention idea before it is released to the public?
Testing an invention idea before its release to the public can be difficult and time consuming. There are a number of ways to go about testing an invention idea before it is released to the public. Some methods include:
1) Testing the idea with potential customers. This can be done through telephone conversations, online surveys, or in-person interviews.

2) Testing the idea with experts. Scientists, engineers, and other inventors can provide feedback on how the product will work and how it would be improved.

3) Conducting market trials. This involves having people test the product in different markets to see what reaction they have.

brainstorming: What are some creative ways to come up with ideas?
Creative ideas are the lifeblood of any business. Whether it's coming up with new ways to market your company or coming up with new products or services, creativity is key. Here are a few creative ideas to get you started: 
1. unconscious brainstorming - This technique is when you come up with ideas without knowing why or how they'll help your business. Just think about what could work and then start thinking about ways to make it a reality. This can be fun because it can result in something that you never thought possible. 
2. using prototypes - A prototype is a version of an idea that's been created specifically for testing and feedback purposes. It can help you explore different aspects of your product before finally committed to making it a reality.
