The Different Types of Ideas: What are they?
Ideas are things that get your mind going and can help you solve problems. There are many different types of ideas, but these are the three most common:
1. The brainstorming idea: This is the idea that you come up with without anything specific in mind. It's just a thought or an idea that pops into your head.

2. The creative idea: This is an external perspective on something that you've already been thinking about or working on. It can help you come up with a new solution or approach to a problem.

3. The problem-solving idea: This is the mental construct that helps you see how everything works together to create a single goal or solution.

Invention ideas come from many sources, including what we know and experience. Our mental models of the world help us come up with new ideas. Mental models can be changed, adapted, or improved upon through creative thinking. Inventions typically come from a combination of these three elements: the idea itself, how it would be useful in the world, and how it can be improved.

Section 3: Tips for stimulating your creativity.
If you're feeling stuck in a creative rut, these tips will help jumpstart your brainstorming sessions and get the ideas flowing again.
1. Take a break from your usual routine and try something new. Getting out of your comfort zone can open up your mind to new possibilities.

2. Set some structure for your brainstorming session by coming up with a specific goal or challenge to focus on. Having a clear objective will help you generate more targeted ideas.

3. Brainstorm with someone else to get fresh perspectives on how to approach the problem you're trying to solve. Collaborating with others can also help spark new ideas that you wouldn't have thought of on your own.
