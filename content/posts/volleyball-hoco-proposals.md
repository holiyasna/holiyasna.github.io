What is the future of technology?
There is no one answer to the question of what the future of technology holds. However, some potential ideas include: 

1. Virtual reality becoming more mainstream- This could involve using headsets to experience virtual worlds that are not actually there. This could help people learn new things and escape stress. 
2. Artificial intelligence becoming more advanced- This could involve creating machines that can think for themselves, and eventually end up taking over many tasks in our lives. 
3. New technologies being developed- Some of these include: quantum computing, 3D printing, and autonomous cars. These are just a few examples, and there are plenty of other possibilities that could be explored in the future.

The impact of invention on society: from novelties to products that saved lives or made a difference
Invention has exploded in recent years as new and innovative technologies have led to products that have made a difference in society. Some of these products have saved lives, such as the iPhone and the Nike sneaker, while others have made a small impact, such as the solar cooker or the artificial intelligence development. However, no product has had a lasting impact on society like the invention of the printing press. The printing press allowed for books to be printed one letter at a time which led to increased communication and helped create an understanding of complex topics across cultures.
