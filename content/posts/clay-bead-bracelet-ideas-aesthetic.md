Tips for Working creatively: What to keep in mind?
Creative ideas can come in all shapes and sizes, but they all have one common goal: to make something new and beautiful. Here are a few tips to help you keep your creative juices flowing:
1. Be open to new ideas ‚Äì anything that makes you think outside the box can be a good idea for a project.

2. Don‚Äôt hesitate to take risks ‚Äì if something seems too risky, let it be. The important thing is that you don‚Äôt give up on your project until it‚Äôs finished, or until you find a better way to do it.

3. Take time to relax ‚Äì working constantly will only lead to stress and fatigue. Instead, take some time for yourself each day, and work on tasks that are more calming and relaxing. This will help you stay focused and motivated throughout the process.
