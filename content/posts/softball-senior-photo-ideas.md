It can be found in all forms of art, but creativity in particular revolves around the idea of composition orlayout. In creative art, the aim is to create something that is unique and different from anything else in the world.

How to: Start with the most common projects and work your way up
If you're just starting out, there are a few things to keep in mind when embarking on your first DIY project. First and foremost, don't be afraid to ask for help – everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses when it comes to construction. And if you have any trouble understanding something or struggling with a project, don't worry; anyone can learn from experience.
Of course, no one is born knowing how to do everything by themselves – that's where the importance of having some type of plan comes in. Not only will this help you avoid becoming overwhelmed and frustrated, but it'll also make sure that your projects get completed on time and without any unforeseen problems. So go ahead and start building – it's the least you can do!
