In the current political and social climate, there are a number of fresh ideas out there that could change the way we live and work. Here are 5 of them:

2. Autonomous Vehicles: This is an idea that has been gaining traction recently due to its potential for reducing traffic congestion and improving public transportation options.
3. Green Energy: The use of green energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydro power has seen a rise in popularity in recent years. This would allow us to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and help address climate change problems.
