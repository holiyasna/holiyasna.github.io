Best ways to save on your energy bill:
Every day, we spend energy to do things that require electricity. Whether itâ€™s turning on the lights or streaming Netflix, we use energy to do things. Now that electricity prices have been high for a while and there are more efficient ways to use power, itâ€™s important to keep an eye on your energy bill and figure out what you can do to save money. Here are some tips:
