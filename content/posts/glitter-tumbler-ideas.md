Brainstroming is a mental puzzle game that can be played on your computer or phone. Players use their brain to guess the order of cards in a deck, and then put them back in the deck so that the next card is at the bottom. The game is scoreless, but players can win by guessing the order of cards in an opponent's deck and putting them back in place so that their own card is at the top.

The Benefits of Big Ideas: Why should we be thinking about big ideas?
Big ideas are the stuff of dreams and innovation. They can be anything from simple, like a new product or service, to groundbreaking, like a new way of thinking about life. And they can be big enough to bring about real change – or simply be interesting enough to inspire others to come up with their own big ideas.
The benefits of big ideas are clear: they drive innovation and creativity, help businesses expand their reach and reach new markets, increase productivity and efficiency, and even improve communication and teamwork. But there are also some key reasons why we should think about big ideas more often – and research has shown that the rewards can be great indeed.

In recent years, there has been an increasing focus on the importance of creativity – both in business circles and as a whole.

The importance of ideas
Ideas are the lifeblood of any organization. Without them, a company would be in trouble. They can be used to improve products or to create new ideas for businesses. But even more important, ideas are the engine that drives innovation and growth.
But what are they? How do they come about? And how do they affect our business?

Ideas come from all over the place. Sometimes they come from people who have had some great ideas, and other times they come from others who have had some great ideas but don't know how to put them into a product or service that can make money for the company.

Ideas also come from customers. Sometimes we get an idea from someone who is using our product or service, and sometimes we get an idea from somebody who is not using our product or service but thinks it would be a good idea.
