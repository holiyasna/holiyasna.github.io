Patenting an invention: How do you do it?
Patenting an invention is a common process used by businesses to protect their ideas and protect them from others who may want to use them without permission. There are several ways to do this, and the most important part is to find the right method for you and your business. Inventors should also be careful when patenting their ideas as they could face infringement lawsuits if someone else uses them without giving credit or sharing in profits.
