The importance of creativity in education
Since the dawn of time, creativity has been an integral part of human existence. It is what has allowed us to survive and thrive as a species. Today, more than ever, creativity is essential for success in all aspects of life.
In education, creativity is just as important as anything else. It allows students to think outside the box, to find new and innovative solutions to problems, and to express themselves in unique ways.

Unfortunately, creativity is often stifled in traditional educational settings. Too much emphasis is placed on conformity and rote learning, instead of encouraging students to explore their own creative potential. This needs to change if we want our children to be successful in an increasingly competitive world.

The definition of creativity
Creativity is a mental process which refers to the ability to come up with new ideas, solutions or products. It can be described in different ways but ultimately it is what makes us unique and makes us stand out from the rest. Creative art is often seen as an area where creativity flourishes, as it offers an escape from reality and allows people to become creative problem solvers. In order to be considered creative, an artist must have a strong imagination, be able to see things in a new light and be willing to experiment.

What is innovation and why is it so important?
The term “innovation” has been around for a long time, but its meaning has changed over time. In the old days, innovation referred to new technology or products. But in the days of digital age, innovation also refers to how we can use technology to improve our lives and businesses.
Innovation is key because it allows companies and individuals to perpetually alter their way of doing things and produce new ideas that can make a difference. It enables us to constantly learn and upgrade our methods so that we are better able to meet the challenges of the world. This is what makes innovation so important – it helps us keep up with the latest trends and developments.
