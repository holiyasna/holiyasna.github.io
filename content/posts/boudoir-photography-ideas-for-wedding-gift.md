Types of creativity: Mental, physical, emotional, spiritual.
Creativity is an intangible quality that can be described in many ways. Mental creativity, for example, refers to the ability to come up with new ideas or solutions quickly and without thought. Physical creativity, on the other hand, refers to the ability to move your body and make physical changes in order to create new ideas or solutions. Emotional creativity, on the other hand, refers to the ability to feel positive emotions such as happiness, joy, joyfulness, and contentment. Spiritual creativity refers to the ability to connect with God or another higher power and come up with new ideas or solutions.

Overcoming creative blocks.
Creativity is a trait that is often associated with artists, musicians, and other professionals in the arts. However, creativity is not just a talent that only these people possess. Everyone has the ability to be creative, but sometimes we can get stuck in a rut and find it difficult to be creative. If you're feeling uninspired, here are a few tips to help you overcome your creative block.
1. Take a break from your project. Sometimes the best way to get out of a funk is to take a break from whatever you're working on. Step away from your work and clear your mind. Go for a walk, watch a movie, or read a book. When you come back to your project, you'll have fresh eyes and a new perspective.

2. Talk to other people about your project.

The future of transportation
The future of transportation is packed with potential. Some of the ideas being floated include: driverless cars, totally autonomous transportation, and even flying cars. All of these projects have a lot of potential to improve our quality of life and save us money in the long run. But how do you go about making these ideas a reality? And what are some early steps that could help make them a reality? Here are four tips: 
1. Start with small steps 
If you want to see large-scale transportation projects take off, itâ€™s important to start with small steps. This means taking things like creating bike lanes or getting single-occupancy vehicles registered on the road. It also means looking at ways to reduce congestion and improve safety. 
2. Get involved in community deliberations 
Community deliberations are key in helping to create successful transportation projects.
