Creativity is an innate quality that many people take for granted. However, without effort, creativity can often be wasted. For example, if you're creative in your artwork but don't have any ideas for products, you may not be successful in business. To be successful, creativity must come from the inside out – with ideas and solutions rather than just pictures in your head.

What are the challenges of having big ideas?
There are a few key challenges that come with having big ideas, according to Jason Fried. Fried is the author of The Lean Startup, a book on how to build successful startups. In his book, he discusses how it can be tough to stay creative and keep up with new ideas when your mind is constantly filled with too many thoughts. 
One challenge is that it can be hard to remember what you just thought of. Another is that it can be difficult to get your thoughts down in writing form. Finally, Fried says that it can be hard to see the big picture when you're thinking about individual products or services.
