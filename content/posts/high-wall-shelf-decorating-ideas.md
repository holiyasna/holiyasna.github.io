Conclusion: What are the benefits and limitations of creativity?
Creativity is an essential part of any creative person’s life. It can help people come up with ideas for new products, services, or projects. But it can also be used to create problems and challenges. For example, creativity can help people come up with new ways to save money on their groceries.
