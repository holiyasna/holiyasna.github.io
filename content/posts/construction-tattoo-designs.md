The telephone: How it was invented and how it has changed
In 1876, Alexander Graham Bell was born in Edinburgh, Scotland. Inventor of the telephone, his most famous invention transformed communication forever. The first words spoken by Bell over his invention were “Mr. Watson–come here–I want to see you.” 
Just one year after the birth of Bell, the first practical telephone was invented by Philipp Reis of Germany. His device could transmit sounds but not intelligible speech. 

Bell continued work on Reis’s design and eventually created an improved version that could transmit speech. On March 10, 1876, Bell made the first successful call between two buildings in Boston. The following month, he received a patent for his invention.

The Origin of Invention: How did Invention come about?
Invention is a process of coming up with a new idea or solution to a problem. It can be something as simple as dreamt up in your head, or something more complex like developing a new product or technique. Inventions often come about when people come up with an idea that others may find valuable. Some inventions, such as the printing press, were developed for the purpose of helping people make money. Other inventions, such as the lightbulb, were created simply to make things better.
