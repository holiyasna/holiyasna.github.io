1. Inventor protection claims are getting more common. 
2. Patent applications are coming in larger numbers, and they're more complex than ever before. 
3. The number of patents granted is also increasing, but there's still a lot of competition for the same rights and permissions.

10 New Storage Ideas to Help You Organize Your Home
New Storage Ideas to Help You Organize Your Home
There are a number of ways to organize your home, and one way is to add storage space. One idea is to add a few shelves to the wall behind your TV or in the corner of the room where you keep your books, movies, and music. Another idea is to use an old cabinet as a makeshift storage unit. You can hang clothes in it, put books on top of it, or put toys in it. A third idea is to create a small interior shrine to your favorite thing. This could be a pottery jar with one of your favorite pieces of art inside, a picture from your childhood that you miss dearly, or any other piece of memorabilia that makes you happy. If you have children, they can help you select items for the shrine. Another way to organize storage is by using bins.
