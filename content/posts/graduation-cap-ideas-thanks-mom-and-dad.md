Definition of creativity: What is needed to be creative?
Creativity is a term that has been used for centuries to describe different aspects of life. In the modern world, creativity is often described as the ability to come up with new ideas or concepts. It can be used in different ways, but generally it refers to the act of coming up with something new. There are many definitions of creativity, but one that is most commonly used is the definition given by Julius Caesar: Creatio est ad astrae bonum.
