Brainstroming is a mental process that helps to focus and organize thoughts. It can be used in both personal and professional settings. The process starts with identifying the main thoughts in your mind and then sorting them into piles or groups. From there, you can start to work on one or more specific tasks based on what you’ve assigned to those thoughts.
