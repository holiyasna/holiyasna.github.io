What are some creative ideas?
Creative ideas come in all shapes and sizes, so it can be hard to know which ones to pursue. Here are some tips on how to find inspiration: 
-Look at what people have already done. This includes looking at art, design, and architecture. Try to see how they have created things that you like and then apply those ideas to your project. 
-Try different methods of creating something new. Use pens, pencils, paper, paints, or clay to create new things. Not everything needs to be composed in words. 
-Think outside the box. Sometimes all you need is a new perspective to start fresh and get inspired.

The role of innovation in business:
Many businesses, including many small businesses, depend on innovation in order to remain competitive. Innovation can be defined as the application of new knowledge and ideas to solve a problem or increase efficiency in a business. Innovation is an essential part of business success, and small businesses especially need to be aware of how they can benefit from it.
There are several ways that small businesses can benefit from innovation, but the most important way is through increased efficiency. Efficiency is the ability of a business to produce goods and services efficiently using resources limited by cost or time. By increasing efficiency, small businesses can save money on their product or service offerings, which will then allow them to invest more in their other products and services. This increased investment will result in better customer service, higher profits, and more sustainable growth.

Increased innovation also leads to new product innovations.
