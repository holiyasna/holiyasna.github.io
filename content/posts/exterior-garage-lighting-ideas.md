Idea for a big goal: What is our biggest goal?
Big goals are powerful tools for getting people to work together and achieve common goals. They can help a team focus on its mission, and create a sense of purpose. 
There are many different ways to create big goals, but here are five tips for creating effective ones: 

1. Start small: Big goals can be created relatively easily if the goal is something that the team is focused on and knows it has a chance of achieving. However, if the goal is something more difficult or time-consuming, it may be more difficult to get everyone together around it. Try starting with something that everyone in the team can understand and achieve. 

2. Break it down: Once the goal has been identified, break it down into smaller tasks that each team member can complete successfully.

How to Choose the Right Tools for Your DIY Projects:
There are a number of factors you need to consider when choosing the right tools for your DIY projects. Here are four tips to help you make the best decision:
1. What you need: You should have a basic understanding of how tools work before beginning any project. If you don't know what you're using, it's hard to be successful. choose the right tool for the job and don't overspend on something you can't use or don't need.

2. The size of the project: smaller tasks may require smaller tools, while bigger projects may require larger tools. Make sure to get a tool that is appropriate for your needs and your skill level.

3. The type of project: Some projects are better suited for one-time use, while others may require more expertise or experience than what is available at home.

Creative people are often misunderstood. They may not be considered “art” people or “design” people, but they have a lot of energy and ideas that can often lead to great things. Creative people are often difficult to pigeonhole, and no one knows what they’re working on until it’s finished.
