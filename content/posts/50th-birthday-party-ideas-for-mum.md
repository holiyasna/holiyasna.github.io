The power of collaboration:
When it comes to creative ideas, two heads are better than one. That’s the power of collaboration.
Working with someone else can help you come up with ideas you never would have thought of on your own. And it can also make the process more fun. But how do you find the right collaborator?

First, look for someone who has complementary skills to yours. If you’re a big-picture thinker, team up with someone who’s good at details. If you’re more of a doer, find someone who’s good at generating ideas.

Second, make sure you have similar goals and values. You want to be on the same page from the start so there are no surprises down the road.

Finally, trust your gut. Go with your instinct when it comes to choosing a collaborator.

In order to be a creative person, you need to understand the basics of creativity. This includes understanding why we feel certain ways and how we use our creativity in our lives.
Creativity is a key word in today’s society. Everyone seems to be looking for ways to be creative or have more creativity in their lives. However, the truth is that you don’t need to be creative in order to be successful. In fact, you can actually achieve success without being creative. You simply need to understand the basics of creativity and how it works so that you can use it in your own life and work.

2020: The United States and China’s new relationship
As the world's two biggest economies start to elbow each other in 2020, it is important to ask what their new relationship will be. What are the key topics of discussion? What challenges does 2020 bring for the two countries? And is there anything in common between them that could help make their relationship stronger?
One area where China and the United States do have some similarities is their commitment to innovation. Beijing has long championed creativity as a way to improve society, and US President Donald Trump has also made innovation one of his priorities. In 2020, this focus will be put into full force as both countries fight against climate change – an issue that China has been advocating for years.

On economic issues, there are some areas where China and the United States have much in common.
