The barriers to innovation
Innovation is a key driver of economic growth. It allows firms to create new products and services and find new ways of doing things. However, innovation can be difficult to achieve. Firms face a number of barriers when trying to innovate, including a lack of resources, a risk-averse culture, and an unwillingness to change.
One of the biggest barriers to innovation is a lack of resources. Many firms do not have the money or the manpower to invest in new ideas. They may also lack the necessary skills and knowledge. This can make it difficult for them to identify opportunities for innovation and develop new products and services.

Another barrier to innovation is a risk-averse culture. Many firms are reluctant to take risks, preferring instead to stick with tried-and-tested methods.

What are some creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be anything that comes to mind, whether it's something new or something that has been done before. There are so many great creative ideas out there that it's hard to know where to start. Here are a few of our favourites: 
1. Idea: Have a creative picnic! This could involve having a picnic table set up in your backyard, eating your favourite food and discussing all of the different ideas you came up with while nourished by the sun and beautiful surroundings. 
2. Idea: Draw some Figures! One great way to get your creativity going is by drawing Figures. This could involve painting them on walls or using markers to create realistic drawings. It's important to find something that inspires you and works well for you, as different types of art can be very differing in how they inspire others.

Invention is the process of creating something new, whether it is a product, a process, or a solution to a problem. Inventors are those who come up with new ideas and turn them into reality. The invention process often begins with an idea, which is then developed through research and experimentation. Once an invention is created, it must be patented to protect the inventor's rights.
