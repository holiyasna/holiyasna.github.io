Invention has been an industry staple for centuries, and it is still a vital part of many businesses today. However, there are some potential obstacles to innovation that could impact the industry negatively. For example, patents can be restrictive and can often hamper the growth of a company. Another obstacle is the lack of collaboration between companies, which can lead to variation in ideas and products. Lastly, there is the risk of technology obsolescence, which could restrict innovation and prevent companies from succeeding in the market.
