4 easy ways to declutter your home
decluttering your home can be a lot of fun and it can help you save money. Here are four easy ways to declutter your home:
1. Get organized. Make sure all of your belongings are in one place and organized according to what type of item it is. This will make it easier to find what you need and move things around when you need to.

2. Get rid of excess clutter. It may seem like every time you take a look at your home, there’s more stuff than ever before, but that’s not the case! Remove any unnecessary items from your home that don’t have a use or purpose anymore. This will free up space and help you save money on your housing costs.

3. Use Craigslist or other online directories for recommendations on deals on new or used furniture and decorations.

Idea 4: What are some creative ways to get ideas from others?
Creative ways to get ideas from others have been around for centuries. Some people find inspiration in nature, others through friends, and still others through creativity itself. Sometimes all you need are a few good ideas and some creativity will come naturally. Here are four creative ways to get ideas from others: 
1) Talk to your friends- prospective clients or customers can be great sources of inspiration when it comes to coming up with new ideas. Ask them what they think, what they’ve done that has inspired them, and see what you can borrow from their work. This could lead to new business opportunities or outright invention! 
2) Take on a project- if there’s something you’re passionate about, take on a project that speaks to that feeling.
