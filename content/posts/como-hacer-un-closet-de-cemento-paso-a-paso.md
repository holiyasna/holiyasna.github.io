coming up with new ways to do things: How can businesses come up with new ideas that work?
Businesses have been coming up with new ideas for years, but it can be hard to pinned down what works and what doesn't. Here are three tips to help you come up with new ideas: 
1. Try different methods of marketing: This might seem like a common-sense tip, but often times the best way to find a new customer is to try something different. Go beyond just traditional methods like advertising and social media promotion. 

2. Be open to change: When it comes time to come up with a new idea, don't be afraid to experiment. Sometimes the best way to find out if something is working is to give it a try and see what happens. 

3. Be persistent: It takes some effort – even stubbornness – to come up with new ideas that work.

Invention 4: a new way to produce energy from renewable resources
Invention ideas can produce energy from renewable resources in a variety of ways, some more efficient than others. One such idea is to create turbines that turn renewable energy into electricity. This could be useful for homes and businesses that do not have access to traditional power sources, or for those who are trying to save money on their energy bill. Another innovation is the use of solar panels to generate energy. These panels can be placed on roofs or in other locations where sunlight shines down on them, and they can also be used to generate power when the sun is not shining.

There are numerous ways in which creativity can be used in art, from creating atmosphere to mood to story. Here are four examples:
1. Atmosphere: by adding a sense of calm or excitement, an artist can create a believable and distracting environment for the viewer to inhabit.
2. Mood: by using different colors and brushstrokes, an artist can create a range of emotions that can be manipulated through composition and color alone.
3. Storytelling: by weaving together disparate elements into one story or plot, an artist can create engaging and dimensional work that becomes both memorable and unforgettable.
