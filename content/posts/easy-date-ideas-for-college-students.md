Definition of big idea: A creative or innovative idea that has the potential to change the way people live, work, and play.
Big ideas are those that have the potential to change the way we live, work, and play. There are many big ideas out there, but it can be tough to find the right one to bring about big results. Sometimes, just having an idea can help you achieve a much-needed goal. Here are five big ideas that could change the way you live and work: 
1. A “big data” platform that collects and analyzes vast amounts of data in order to provide insights for businesses and consumers. This would allow businesses to make better decisions faster, while consumers could gain access to information they wouldn’t otherwise have access to.

2. A new payment method that allows anyone with an internet connection and a phone or tablet device to easily pay for goods and services using their phones or tablets.

Conclusion: What are some tips for coming up with great ideas?
Ideas are a huge part of any business. They can be used in many ways to create new ideas, or come up with great ones. Here are some tips for coming up with great ideas: 1. Do your research: How do you know what is best for your company and what is possible? Take the time to read about different businesses, their strategies, and how they achieve their goals. This will help you create a better understanding of what you want to pursue. 2. Be open-minded: Don’t be afraid to try something new. There are always opportunities for growth when one takes risks. 3. Be persistent: If you don’t keep trying, eventually someone will give up on you and move on to another idea. 4. Take opportunity seriously: You never know when an opportunity will present itself again – so take advantage of it!
