For example, if you are a math genius and want to be a financial advisor, your brain might move to the temporal lobe in order to better process numbers.

What do we mean by big ideas?
When it comes to big ideas, there's no one definitive answer. What matters most is what the idea can do for people, and how it could change the way they live and work.

Here are five tips for coming up with big ideas:
