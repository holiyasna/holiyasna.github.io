What is brainstroming and what does it mean for business?
What is brainstroming and what does it mean for business?
Brainstroming is a term used to describe the activity of brainstorming. Brainstorming is an effective way to come up with new ideas and solutions to problems. When done correctly, brainstroming can lead to improved business plans, strategies and operations. However, there are a few things to keep in mind when trying to achieve brainstroming success.

1) Brainstorming should be formed into teams or groups in order to provide more cohesion. This will help prevent members from working on individual projects at the same time.
2) Brainstorming should be focused on solving real-world problems rather than just coming up with new ideas. This will help your team become more knowledgeable about the problem at hand and can help you develop better solutions.

The history of invention ideas: How has innovation changed over time?
Invention ideas have changed over time, and as a result, the history of Invention Ideas is reflective of that. One way invention ideas have changed is in how they are created.  In the past, invention ideas were often based on scientific understanding at the time they were conceived. However, as technology advances and new knowledge becomes available, more and more innovation ideas are born from scratch. This new creativity allows for faster response tochanging needs and developments in technology.
One example of this new creativity is the cellular phone. Cellular phones were first invented back in 1984 by American scientist Neil Armstrong and his colleague Rick Stratham. The telephone was originally designed to be a basic communication resource for soldiers in war-time. However, after seeing how useful cellular phones could be for civilians, Armstrong and Stratham decided to create a product that could be used by everyone including business people and everyday citizens.
