How to develop them: Be creative
Invention ideas don't just come to people in a sudden eureka moment; usually, it's the result of a process of development. If you want to learn how to develop your own invention ideas, there are a few things you can do. 
First, take some time to brainstorm and think about the problems you encounter in your daily life. What would make your life easier? What does not work well or efficiently? Once you have identified some potential areas for improvement, do some research to see if anyone else has had the same idea. 

Next, start thinking about possible solutions to the problem. How could it be fixed? What would be the best way to achieve this? Try to come up with several different ideas, and then evaluate each one. Which one is most feasible? Which one would be the most effective?

The 5 Big Ideas of Creativity
Creativity is an important concept in our lives. It can be used to come up with new ideas, or to find solutions to problems. Here are five big ideas of creativity: 1. One can be creative when they are thinking out loud – this means that they are not just focusing on one thing. They are brainstorming and working on multiple ideas simultaneously. This is an excellent way to get inspired and come up with new ideas. 2. One can be creative when they are working alone – this means that they have complete freedom and control over their work space. They can work on whatever they want, and no one else is interfering or checking them out. This can be a great way to come up with unique and innovative ideas. 3. One can be creative when they are working with others – this means that they are collaborating with other people throughout the entire process of creating something.
