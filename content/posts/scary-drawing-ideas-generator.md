Why should someone take a big idea and turn it into a reality?
There are a few reasons why an idea can become something real. Maybe it's because it has the potential to solve a problem people have been dealing with for years, or maybe it's got the potential to change the way people live their lives. Whatever the reason, turning an idea into reality is something that can be difficult but definitely worth doing.
