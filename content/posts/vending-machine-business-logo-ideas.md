What is innovation and how does it differ from other types of creativity?
Innovation is a process of creating new ideas or products that solve a problem. It can come in many forms- from the invention of the telephone to the development of new drugs. 
One important difference between innovation and creativity is that innovation typically involves more than one person. In order to create something new, you need to come up with a solution that meets the needs of your audience and is unique to them. On the other hand, creativity often comes from within- people working on their own projects without any outside help. This type of creativity often produces more original ideas and products than those developed in collaboration.

There is no definitive answer when it comes to whether a project is easy or difficult. However, some key factors that can help determine the difficulty level of a project include the resources available, the complexity of the task, and the team's inexperience. Additionally, if a project is assigned to an inexperienced team, then it may be more difficult to complete than if it is assigned to a more experienced team.

Section 3: Tips for stimulating your creativity.
If you're feeling stuck in a creative rut, these tips will help jumpstart your brainstorming sessions and get the ideas flowing again.
1. Take a break from your usual routine and try something new. Getting out of your comfort zone can open up your mind to new possibilities.

2. Set some structure for your brainstorming session by coming up with a specific goal or challenge to focus on. Having a clear objective will help you generate more targeted ideas.

3. Brainstorm with someone else to get fresh perspectives on how to approach the problem you're trying to solve. Collaborating with others can also help spark new ideas that you wouldn't have thought of on your own.
