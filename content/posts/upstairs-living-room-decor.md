Ideas for health care: What can we do to improve access to health care?
There are many ways to improve access to health care, but some of the most common solutions include creating more affordable and accessible clinics and hospitals, expanding Medicaid, and improving the quality of care available through the Veterans Affairs system. There are also many ideas for reform that can be proposed in order to improve the overall experience for patients who use health care services. For example, a program that provides free preventive services could help reduce the number of doctor visits and hospitalizations related to health problems. Another idea is to tryouts for new medical treatments in order to find which ones work best on a individual basis.

Invention of the World Wide Web
In 1839, Nicholas-Jacques Conte wrote a paper on the idea of a world wide web, which would eventually be called the Internet. The first real steps were made in 1947 when Claude Shannon and others developed the theory of information theory, which allowed for the Transmission of Information over Communications Channels. The following year, IBM created an electronic computer called Punchy, which was used to test communication protocols on. In 1951, Xerox PARC developed the Alto computer system that could be connected to a network. On August 29th of that year, US president Harry Truman announced his plan to create the American National Telecommunications Commission (ANTC), which would control all federal telecommunications regulations. This was the beginning of what is now known as the Internet era.
