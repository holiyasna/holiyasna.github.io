Brainstorming: How do you come up with ideas for your blog or article?
Brainstorming ideas for your blog or article can be one of the most fun and rewarding aspects of writing. Not only do you get to think up new ideas, but you also get to share your own with others. Here are a few creative ways to come up with brainstorming ideas for your next blog post or article:
1. Take on a project that you have always wanted to do but never found the time to do. This could be something as simple as creating a list of all your favorite foods from around the world, or taking on a project that has been on your radar for a while but you just haven’t had the time to dive into it.

2. Take on an existing topic and see if you can make it more creative and interesting by exploring different angles or points of view.
