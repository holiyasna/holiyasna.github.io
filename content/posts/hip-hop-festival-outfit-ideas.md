Uses for inventions: What can you do with an invention?
Inventions offer a new way to do something, make a product or change the way we live. They can be helpful in many ways, from improving safety to solving problems we face every day. Sometimes an invention can be used for its own sake - like a new phone case that protects your phone - but other times an inventor might create an invention for a company or organization, hoping to improve their product or service. Here are some examples of how inventions have been used in the past: 
-An inventor created the first airbag system that saved lives on a highway in 1937.
-An inventor developed the global positioning system (GPS) in the 1990s so drivers could find their way around without having to look at Maps.
-Inventionists have created numerous devices and appliances since the turn of the century, such as solar chargers and anxiety pills.
