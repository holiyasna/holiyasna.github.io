Creative Process: How do you come up with creative ideas?
Creative ideas come to us in all shapes and forms - they can be things we never even thought of, or something that was sitting at the back of our mind but we just couldn't seem to get started on.
Whatever the creative process is, it involves some kind of brainstorming or problem solving. Once you've come up with a few ideas, it's important to work on those ideas until you have a good one. And then it's onto the next step - finding a way to put those ideas into action.
