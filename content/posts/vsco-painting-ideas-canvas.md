Definition of innovation: How does innovation differ from other types of change?
Innovation is a new way of doing things, or a change in the way things are done. Innovation can apply to any type of business, but it's most common in the technology and business sectors.
Different types of innovation can have different effects on businesses. For example, change in product design can lead to increased sales; change in distribution methods can lead to new customer base; and change in customer service systems can create new opportunities for growth.

There are a number of factors that go into defining innovation, including the specific industry or sector where it's being applied, the goals for the innovation, and how well it's executed. There are also five main characteristics that define innovation: risk-taking, creative thinking, rapid response time, team collaboration, and systemic impact.

Types of innovation
Innovation comes in many different forms, and it is one of the most important aspects of any business. There are three main types of innovation: product, process, and business model.
Product innovation is all about creating new products or improving existing ones. This can be anything from coming up with a new invention to making small changes to an existing product. Process innovation is all about improving the way that products are made, such as introducing new methods or technologies. Business model innovation is all about changing the way that businesses operate, such as introducing new business models or ways of selling products.

Each type of innovation has its own benefits and challenges. Product innovation can lead to new revenue streams, but it can also be risky and expensive. Process innovation can improve efficiency and quality, but it can also be disruptive to existing operations.
