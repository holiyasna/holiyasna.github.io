Creative thinking can help you solve problems
Creative thinking can help you solve problems. This isn't just a slogan, it's a law of the land. And if you're not using it, you're missing out on an opportunity to make some serious strides in your career and life. Here are four ways to get started: 
1. Take a break from reality: Try Problem-O-Maticity or The Break with Reality. These programs ask you to come up with five problems that challenge your current understanding of reality and then see how you can improve upon or even solve them. Afterward, take a few minutes to reflect on what came away from the session and how you would have tackled the first four problems. 

2. Make connections: What does creativity look like? What do different writers, artists, and thinkers share in common that makes them unique?

Creativity is an essential part of any creative artist’s process. The way a creative artist goes about creating work varies depending on the artist and their unique strengths and weaknesses. However, some basic steps that any creativeartist must take in order to create excellent work are as follows:
1. Determine what you want your work to be. This includes answering the question, “What does this piece of art represent for me?” After answering this question, you can begin to develop ideas for what your piece may look like or how it could be done.

2. Come up with a title and concept for your work. Once you have a title and concept, it is time to start developing the plot or story behind your work. This will involve coming up with characters and setting the scene for your story.

3. Start writing!
