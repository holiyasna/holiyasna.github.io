What are some ideas?
When it comes to ideas, no one is an expert. Everyone has different ideas and opinions on what should be done, which is why it's important to have a general idea of what you're looking for when coming up with ideas. Here are some key tips to help you get started:
1. Consider the audience: What will the idea be effective for? Is it for a small group of people, or a large one? What are their needs and wants?

2. Think about potential solutions: Once you've determined who or what your target audience is, consider what problems could be solved by using the given idea.

The benefits of brainstorming
The benefits of brainstorming are vast. By taking the time to brainstorm, you allow yourself to explore all possible options and ideas for a project, task, or goal. This can lead to better decision making, improved efficiency, and increased creativity.
