Types of creativity: Solo, team work, creative partnership
Creative art is the expression of ideas, emotions, and thoughts through the medium of art. There are many types of creativity that can be expressed through art, but one of the most common is solo creativity. This type of creativity occurs when a person creates their own artwork without any help from a team or other creatives. It can be a great way to get your creative juices flowing and to work on projects by yourself. However, there are also times when itâ€™s helpful to work with others in order to create more effective and efficientartwork. This type of collaboration can result in increased productivity and better results.
