The history of innovation: From the Greeks to the Silicon Valley
Innovation has a long and storied history, which can be traced back to the Greeks. They were the first to conceive of the modern industrial revolution, which is often credited with invalidating feudalism. In addition, they also invented hydraulics and pneumatics, among other sciences.

Conclusion: What are some of the best ways to get started exploring new ideas?
In any given field of study, there are a variety of ways to get started. Here are a few tips for getting started in new ideas: 
-Start with smaller pieces. Start by trying out a couple of different ideas and seeing what pops into your mind. This will give you a base from which to build more complex concepts around. 
-Capture the idea in an easily remembered phrase or image. This will help you retain the memory for as long as possible and will encourage you to come up with other similar ideas. 
-Ask around. Go online, talk to friends, or attend meeting after meeting to see if anyone has any specific ideas about what youâ€™re looking for. This way, you wonâ€™t have to start from scratch every time you want to think of something new.
