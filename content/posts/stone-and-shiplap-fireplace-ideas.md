Eco-Friendly Home Improvements: How can you make your home more eco-friendly?
Eco-friendly home improvements are easy to make if you take the time to think about what you need and want. Here are a few ideas to help make your home more eco-friendly:
1. Make sure your heating and cooling system is eco-friendly. Not only will this save you money in the long run, but it can also help improve your environment by reducing emissions from your home.

2. Use recycled materials in your construction. When building or repairing your home, be sure to use recycled materials whenever possible. This not only saves you money in the long run, but it also helps reduce environmental impact on both of our planet’s inhabitants and future generations.

3. Use rainwater tanks rather than water systems that use water fluoridation products.

The three types of creativity: Intuitive, Analytical, and Exact
Creativity is a result of the interaction between two or more factors. These factors can be called intuition and analysis, or exactly. Intuitive creativity is the result of an individual's natural ability to connect with the world and see patterns. Analytical creativity is founded on reason and analysis, which can help individuals see how things work and how they can be improved. 
Exact creativity is when an individual has a specific idea and they go into deep analysis to make it a reality. This type of creativity often requires focus and dedication, as it can be difficult to change your mind after you have initial ideas. However, if done correctly, this type of creativity can lead to amazing products and solutions.

The State of Invention Today
Invention is a vital part of our economy and society. Yet, it has been difficult to keep up with the growth of invention. Inventions have become more common, but the number of new ideas remains low. This lack of innovation is costing society billions of dollars each year in lost revenue and jobs.
Despite these costs, there is still a lot that we can learn from the history of invention. For example, some inventions were originally created for no other purpose than to solve a problem. Other inventions were made just for fun or as an experiment. But even the simplest inventions can have big consequences. For example, the Telephone was invented to make communication more efficient and cost-effective. Today, it plays an important role in our lives and economy.

There are several ways to help rise awareness about Invention and keep it alive.
