The Three Types of Ideas: What are they and how should you use them?
Ideas are a type of ammunition that can be used to improve a person's productivity, creativity and overall outlook. There are three main types of ideas: operational, problem-solving and innovative.
Operational ideas involve tasks that can be completed quickly and easily. These include things like fixing a car or getting the cat out of the dog's toy box. Problem-solving ideas involve taking several steps in order to find a solution to a problem. These include solving an equation for example, or figuring out how to make something work better. Inventive ideas involve coming up with new ways to do something, or finding an old way of doing something and adapting it to new circumstances.

Types of creativity: Solo, team work, creative partnership
Creative art is the expression of ideas, emotions, and thoughts through the medium of art. There are many types of creativity that can be expressed through art, but one of the most common is solo creativity. This type of creativity occurs when a person creates their own artwork without any help from a team or other creatives. It can be a great way to get your creative juices flowing and to work on projects by yourself. However, there are also times when it’s helpful to work with others in order to create more effective and efficientartwork. This type of collaboration can result in increased productivity and better results.
