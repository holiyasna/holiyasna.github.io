Idea #3:
Ideas are the bedrock of any successful enterprise. Whether you're starting a business, developing a new product, or simply trying to solve a problem, having a great idea is the first step.
But what makes a great idea? And how can you come up with one? Here are three key tips:

1. Look for problems to solve. A great idea usually comes from solving a problem. So if you're looking for an idea, start by identifying problems that need solving. This could be something as simple as making your daily commute more efficient, or it could be something more complex like developing a new treatment for cancer.

2. Brainstorm with others. Sometimes the best ideas come from collaboration. If you're stuck, try brainstorming with friends, family, or colleagues.
