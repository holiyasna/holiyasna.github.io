The future of inventions: What needs to be done in order for new inventions to thrive?
Inventions have always been a part of humanity’s history, but as the world has become more complex, so too has the need for new inventions. This is especially true in today’s world, where technology is constantly evolving and becoming more advanced. In order for new inventions to thrive, however, there are several key things that need to be done. 
One of the most important things that needs to be done is to make sure that new inventions are passed on from one generation to the next. This can be done by creating a system where people can share ideas for new inventions with each other, and then testing and dubbing them into products or services. It also helps to create a market for these products or services by attracting investors who can help to bring these products or services to market quickly.

Creativeblocking: What is it and how can it help you be more creative?
Creativeblocking is a term that has been mentioned in a few places, but mostly as an afterthought. Most people seem to think of it as a thing that happens to creatives when they try to do something new or different, and it takes up space in their brain. But what is creativeblocking really? Is it something that you have to experience for yourself to understand, or can it be learned? Here are 8 things you need to know about creativeblocking if you want to be more creative: 
1) It starts with setting your boundary

One of the best ways to help avoid blocking creativity is by setting boundaries early on. When you know what your limits are, you can get more out of your creativity. This means setting clear expectations for yourself and not trying to do too much at once.
