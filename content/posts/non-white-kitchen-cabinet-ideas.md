How Invention began
Invention is a process of creating something new and often involving the use of an unknown or unusual tool. Many inventions have originated from the simplest concepts, such as a design for a shirt that was first conceived by a tailor. Other inventions, like the transistor, were created through years of trial and error before they were finally realized in devices such as radios and TVs. Inventions can be so important to our society that they are often consideredtreasures, and some have even been donated to universities or used in scientific research.

Definition of Invention: inventions are the results of creative thinking.
Invention is the result of creative thinking. This thinking can be done in a number of ways, but the most common way to come up with new ideas is through brainstorming. brainstorming is an informal process where people share their ideas with one another, without any specific goal in mind. By doing this, you can come up with a number of new ideas that could potentially be used in a product or service.
What makes brainstorming so helpful is that it allows for creativity to freely flow. When people areallowed to go at their own pace and have unrestricted access to their thoughts, they are more likely to come up with new and innovative solutions. This quality helps inventions become more effective and innovation becomes more commonplace.
