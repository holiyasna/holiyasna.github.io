Outcomes of Creative Ideas: What happens when you use creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be really helpful in terms of solving problems or improving the quality of a product or service. However, they can also have negative outcomes if not used correctly. Here are five tips to get the most out of creative ideas:
1. Make sure your ideas are sound. It’s impossible to come up with great ideas without some form of understanding what you’re trying to achieve. Make sure your concepts are clear, executable, and likely to work in practice.

2. Take a step back first. While it may be tempting to take things one step further and come up with something truly unique, doing so could actually backfire if it doesn’t have a real bearing on the problem at hand.

Invention processes: What happens during the invention process?
Invention is the process that occurs during which a new idea or invention is created. This can be done through the creation of a new product, service, or idea. Inventions can also come about through the research and development of a new product. While both processes are essential to the success of an invention, they are also different. 
The invention process typically involves three steps: ideation, development, and commercialization. Ideation happens when an inventor has a great idea for a product or service and it doesn't yet have a name or prototype. Development happens when the inventor comes up with a working prototype of their product or service. Commercialization happens when someone decides to make their product or service available to the public. 

While all three steps are important, they each have their own importance.

Thesis: What are the new ideas?
Some of the new ideas that have been brought to light in the past few years are artificial intelligence, biomarkers and machine learning. In this article, we will focus on one particular idea- artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence is a process that uses machines to create or interpret text or other forms of information. It has been used in various ways such as for gaming, speech recognition, and more. 
One of the main advantages of artificial intelligence is its ability to learn quickly and make decisions without being explicitly programmed. This makes it ideal for tasks such asAutonomous Patrols or airport security. Another advantage is its ability to improve our understanding of the world around us. For example, if you were looking for a restaurant, AI could help you find one that was close by or give you recommendations based on your interests.
