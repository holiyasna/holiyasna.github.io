Online brainstorming: the power of the virtual brainstorm
1. Brainstorming is a process that helps us generate new ideas and solutions to problems.
2. It is a powerful tool that can be used to solve complex problems and come up with innovative solutions.
3. Brainstorming can be done alone or in groups, and it can be done online or offline.
4. Online brainstorming has many advantages over offline brainstorming, such as the ability to connect with people from all over the world, the ability to share ideas instantaneously, and the ability to get feedback quickly.
5. Offline brainstorming has its own advantages, such as the ability to focus more deeply on one's own thoughts, the opportunity to build relationships with team members, and the chance to brainstorm in person.

Idea 2: We need to create more opportunities for people to learn
There are many ways that people can learn new things. Some people learn through books, others through conversation, and still others through online resources. In order to create more opportunities for people to learn, we should consider creating more interactive learning experiences. These experiences could include:
-Teams: A team learning experience is a great way for students to work together and learn from one another.Team building activities can be used in a variety of ways, such asctoring lectures or discussing research papers with classmates.

-Video Lessons: Adding video lessons into classrooms can help students learn by watching it instead of reading it. This type of learning is convenient because students have time to stop and watch the lesson while they are working on other tasks.

-Blogs: Blogging can be a great way for students to share their ideas, thoughts, and experiences with others.

The definition of invention has changed over time
Invention is an act or process of creating a new product or service from scratch. The definition of invention has changed over time, and the definition of what constitutes an invention has also changed.  In 1876, the International Convention on Patents gave a definitive definition of an invention: "A new production method, composition, use or application of any natural or artificial material." 
However, in 1992, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) revised its rules on what constituted an invention. Previously, inventions were considered to be "natural phenomena" that had not been produced by man. However, under this revision, "natural phenomena" no longer had to be novel; they could just be useful products that had not been used before.
