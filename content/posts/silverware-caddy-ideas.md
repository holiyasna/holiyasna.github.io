How do you find creativity in your artwork?
Creativity is a quality that is often hard to find in everyday life. It can be found in the simplest things, like the way you see the world. When you take the time to think about what you're doing, creativity will come to mind. You'll see something that doesn't look like anything else and start to imagine how it could be used. This can be done in your own artwork or in your everyday life, whichever is more interesting to you.
