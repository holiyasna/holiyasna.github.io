When it comes to innovation, there are a few potential dangers that often come with it. Some of these potential dangers could have a negative effect on businesses, consumers and even the innovation industry itself. Here are four examples:
1. Lacking enough sober consideration can lead to reckless Innovation.
2. False assumptions can be created automatically and without much thought, leading to more risky and potentially harmful innovations.
