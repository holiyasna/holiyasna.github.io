Invention process: How do inventors create new ideas?
Invention processes vary depending on the type of invention, and how new ideas are created. Some common methods include brainstorming, R&D, and ideation. Inventors often use different methods to create new ideas.
 brainstorming is a process where inventors come up with new ideas by thinking about what they don't know. The inventors can use any tool to help them come up with new ideas- such as paper, pencils, or a computer.

R&D is another name for brainstorming. It involves researching what other people have done and finding potential problems that could be solved by using a certain idea. This can take place in the form of studies or prototypes.

Ideation is another way to create new ideas. It's when inventors think about things that have never been thought of before and come up with possible solutions to problems.
