Creative art is any form of art that is not based on literal or historical reality. This includes both expressively creative art and abstraction. Expressively creative art often uses creativity to escape from reality. An example of this would be a painting that doesn't represent a real-world object, but instead usesimagery or myth to create a unique experience. An example of an abstract artist's work could be a painting without any specific objects or movements, allowing the viewer to imagine what it might look like.

The Role of Innovation in the Future of Business: What will be the most significant changes in the future as a result of innovation?
Innovation is a key part of the future of business. It allows businesses to make new products and services that can be sold to customers and increase profits. But with innovation comes risk, which can lead to new products or services not being successful and costing more than those that were initially created. Innovation also requires time and money, which can be difficult to come by in some cases.
But while innovation may be a necessary part of the future of business, it is not always easy to come by. In some cases, companies have to invest in researching and developing new ideas for products or services in order to bring them to market quickly. This takes time, money, and effort ‚Äì all of which may not be available in other times or situations.

So while innovation may not always be easy to come by, it is an essential part of the future of business.
