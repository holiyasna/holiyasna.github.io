Innovation has been successful in many industries and sectors over the years, but there are some lessons that can be learned from some of the most successful implementations.

The service allowed users to easily communicate with one another without having to leave their computers. It also became one of the first online services to offer free email storage for users. In addition, Gmail was originally designed as a way for small businesses to connect with larger companies and share files easier than ever before.
