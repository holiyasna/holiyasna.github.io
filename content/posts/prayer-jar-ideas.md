The history of creative art: What led to its rise in popularity over the centuries?
Creative art is a centuries-old practice that has enjoyed a resurgence in popularity in recent years. The practice is often defined by its ability to inspire awe and provoke thought, and has been used to communicate messages of creativity, beauty, and morality for centuries. Despite its antiquity, there are a number of key reasons why creative art has become so popular in recent times. One reason is the growing trend of people being interested in using their own creativity to create things that they can be proud of. Additionally, creative art can be used as a form of self-expression, and can be used to teach children about different aspects of life and culture.

The power of big ideas
Big ideas are what drive innovation, creativity and success. They are the seeds of new thoughts and ideas that can change the course of a company or individual. Here, we explore four powerful ways to get big ideas in your head:
1. Get inspired by others: Take a look around you and see how others are able to come up with amazing solutions or new ideas. What do they do that you can't? Why did they do it that way and what were their results?

2. Adopt a principle: There's no need to be unique if you have a principle at the heart of your idea. Look for someone who has already done something great on this topic and copy their approach/methodology/mesurement/whatever it is.
