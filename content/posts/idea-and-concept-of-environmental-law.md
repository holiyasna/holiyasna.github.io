Those who are able to think outside the box and come up with new ways to solve problems are the ones who drive innovation forward.

Fulfilling a Dream: How can you turn your creative ideas into a reality?
A creative idea is like a dream. You may not know what it is, but you know that it's something that you want to do. If you can put your mind to it, and make it a reality, you'll be able to enjoy your idea even more. Here are four tips for turning your creative ideas into reality:
1. Do some research first: When you're coming up with ideas for products or services, it's important to get as much information as possible before starting anything. Not only will this help make sure that what you're suggested is something that will work for your target market, but it can also save you time and money in the long run.

2. Don't be afraid to ask for help: No matter how creative your ideas are, there's always someone out there who can help turn them into a reality.

The computer: How it was invented and how it has changed
In 1876, American inventors Charles Babbage and Herman Hollerith created the first mechanical computers. These early machines were complex and expensive, and they could only be used by trained mathematicians and engineers. In 1937, British mathematician Alan Turing published a paper that described how a machine could be built to perform any type of calculation. Turing's paper inspired many scientists and engineers to begin work on electronic computers. In 1941, German engineer Konrad Zuse designed and built the first programmable computer. The first computers were large, expensive, and used vacuum tubes for circuitry.
