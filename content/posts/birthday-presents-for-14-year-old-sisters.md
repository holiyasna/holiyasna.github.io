How do these ideas differ from what we have learned so far?
This article is about two different ideas that have been developed recently in the field of cognitive science. The first idea is called the "mind-brain" model and the second is called the "multitasking model." The mind-brain model is based on the idea that there is a single brain that oversees all our activities and thinks for us. The multitasking model is based on the idea that we can be responsible for multiple tasks at once and still think clearly.
