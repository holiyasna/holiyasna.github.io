What are big ideas?
Big ideas are important, and they can help spur new thought and innovation. Here are some of the most common big ideas:
1. We can all be more creative. big ideas can come from anywhere, but creativity is often found in the imagination. The more we can tap into our creativity, the better we'll be able to think of new ways to improve things.

2. There's no one right way to do something. Just because something seems impossible or impossible-minded, that doesn't mean it isn't possible or reasonable to try out for a change. A big idea is just a suggestion - so try out different ideas until you find the one that works best for you and your situation.

3. Disruptive innovation is key to success in any industry.

Definition of invention:
Invention definitions vary by country, so it's important to define what an invention is before discussing it in further detail. In the United States, for example, an invention is a new product or service that has never been produced before. Inventions can be made from anything from scratch, to a variation on existing technology. They can even come from ideas someone had while brainstorming during their day job.
There are many different ways to define Invention when discussing it with others. However, the most common definition of an invention is something that has never been done before. This definition can be used to describe any new product or service you may come up with.
