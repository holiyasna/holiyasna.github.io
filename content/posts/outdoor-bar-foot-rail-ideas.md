The brainstroming phenomenon is a term used to describe a mental state in which a person has high levels of focus and concentration on one thing. Brainstroming can be described as being in a "zombie zone." This state can be caused by a variety of reasons such as stress, boredom, or fatigue.

How does creativity work?
Creativity is a process that involves the use of imagination and creativity. It is important to note that creativity does not work in a straight line, but rather it is constantly evolving. This means that it can change and develop over time. Creative art often contains elements of the Unknown or the inexplicable, which allows for the viewer to interact with the artwork in a different way than if it were just a series of instructions written down.

How Innovation Can Benefit Your Business: from Cut Costs to Higher Productivity
Innovation is the process of coming up with new ways to do something. It can help businesses cut costs and increase productivity, but there are a few considerations that businesses should make before implementing innovation. First, innovation can be risky - if it doesn't work out, it can cost a lot of money and time to fix. Second, some innovations may not be appropriate for every business - if they're not well-suited to your company's culture or mission, you may find that they don't work as well in the long run. Finally, it's important to remember that innovation often requires time and effort - if you don't take the necessary steps to implement it properly, you could see marginal results for a longer period of time.

Creative process: How does the creative process work, and how does it differ from other forms of intelligence?
Creative process: How does it work?
There is no one answer to this question as the creative process is different for everyone. However, there are some general principles that can be followed to help create valuable and successful products or ideas. 

The creative process begins with the idea or concept. This can be anything from a question that needs to be answered to a plan of how something should be done. From here, it is up to the individual to decide whether they want to pursue the idea or not. If they do, they will need some help in order to turn it into a reality. This includes coming up with a name, designing the prototype, and making sure everything is ready for production. Once all of these steps are complete, it is finally up to the customer or user to test and give feedback before finalizing their decision.
