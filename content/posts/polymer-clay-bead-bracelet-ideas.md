The different types of objectives you might come up with in order to create an idea are imaginary, fantastic, and possible. Imaginary objectives are where you forget the end goal or what the final outcome will be. Fantastical objectives are where you think about things that couldnâ€™t actually happen but could still make senses if done in a certain way.

Brainstorming: What are some great ways to come up with new ideas?
This article is about brainstorming ideas, and how to come up with new ones. There are a few things to keep in mind when brainstorming: 
- Make sure you have a wide range of ideas - Brainstorming can be helpful if you have a few good ideas but no specific plan for calling them all together. 

- Be organized - When you have a bunch of great ideas, it can be helpful to jot them down in order of importance. This will help you keep track of what's important and which ones need more work. 

- Be patient - It can take some time to come up with good ideas. Don't get discouraged if your first batch doesn't seem as great as you wanted it to. You can always try again later.

Differences between creative visual and auditory artists: Visual artists typically paint or sculpt while auditory artists listen to music or read books. Kinesthetic artists may use their body to create works of art. Gustatory artists may choose flavors or smells to add
Visual artists typically paint or sculpt while auditory artists listen to music or read book. While the two mediums have certain similarities, there are also significant differences that can make a difference in the way an artist creates their work. For example, visual artists often use colors and shapes to create patterns and images while auditory artists often listen to music or read books as sources of inspiration. Additionally, visual artists may use more abstract techniques while auditory artists may prefer more realistic portrayals of their subjects. While these differences may seem minor, they can make a huge impact in the way an artist completes their work.
