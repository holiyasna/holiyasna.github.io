Definition of invention:
Invention definitions vary by country, so it's important to define what an invention is before discussing it in further detail. In the United States, for example, an invention is a new product or service that has never been produced before. Inventions can be made from anything from scratch, to a variation on existing technology. They can even come from ideas someone had while brainstorming during their day job.
There are many different ways to define Invention when discussing it with others. However, the most common definition of an invention is something that has never been done before. This definition can be used to describe any new product or service you may come up with. If you're thinking of creating a new idea for a product or service, you might want to try and come up with a definition of Invention first to get started.
