conclusion
In conclusion, creativity is key in many aspects of life. It can be the difference between a successful outcome and a complete disaster.

First, try to come up with new ideas by brainstorming with yourself or others. If you’re stuck, try looking at things from a different perspective or taking a break from whatever you’re working on. Once you have some ideas, it’s important to take action and turn those ideas into reality. Be persistent and don’t give up if something doesn’t work out the first time – creative thinking is all about trial and error.

Definition of innovation: How does it differ from previous generations?
Innovation is the process of coming up with a new idea or product that is different from what has been done before. It can be classified into two main categories, incremental and revolutionary. Incremental innovation occurs in areas such as technology, business, and marketing; while revolutionary innovation occurs in areas such as science, medicine, and the environment. 
The definition of innovation has changing over time, but two main aspects have remained consistent: it should be creative, and it should be new to the market. Innovations should also be feasible to implement quickly and cost-effective. In order to achieve these goals, companies must have a clear understanding of how innovation works and how to define it narrowly or expansively according to their needs.
