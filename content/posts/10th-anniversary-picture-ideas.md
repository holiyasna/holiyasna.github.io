The Challenge of Innovation: How do we stay ahead of the curve?
Innovation is a challenge for any organization, but it's especially hard to keep up with the curve when it comes to technology. Many times, innovation can come from scratch or from taking an existing product and changing its features or design. But whether it's something as simple as a new way of packaging food or a transformed business model, staying ahead of the curve can be tricky.
One way to overcome this challenge is to build on what others have done before. This can be done through collaboration and learning from others, as well as by listening carefully to what customers want and need. It's also important to focus on what customers want most, rather than just trying to please everyone.
