Overcoming creative blocks: what to do when you can't think of anything
When you feel like you can't think of anything, it can be frustrating. But there are ways to overcome creative blocks. Here are a few ideas: 
1. Take a break: Sometimes when you feel like you can't think of anything, it's because you've been thinking too hard. Step away from your work and take a break. Go for a walk, watch a movie, or read a book. Once you take your mind off of your project, you may find that the ideas start flowing again.

2. Talk to someone: When you're feeling stuck, talking to someone else can give you some fresh perspective. Brainstorm with a friend or colleague. They may have some ideas that you hadn't thought of before.

Conclusion: What are some of the best ways to get started exploring new ideas?
In any given field of study, there are a variety of ways to get started. Here are a few tips for getting started in new ideas: 
-Start with smaller pieces. Start by trying out a couple of different ideas and seeing what pops into your mind. This will give you a base from which to build more complex concepts around. 
-Capture the idea in an easily remembered phrase or image. This will help you retain the memory for as long as possible and will encourage you to come up with other similar ideas. 
-Ask around. Go online, talk to friends, or attend meeting after meeting to see if anyone has any specific ideas about what you’re looking for. This way, you won’t have to start from scratch every time you want to think of something new.
