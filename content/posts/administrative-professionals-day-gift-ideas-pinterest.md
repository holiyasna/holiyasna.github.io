The Structure of the article: What are your thoughts on the structure of an article? Are you thinking about writing a top 5 or 10 list, or doing a more traditional approach with each section)?
There are a lot of different ways to write an article, and the structure of an article is definitely one of them. The structure of an article can be broken down into four main categories: introduction, body, conclusion, and discussion.

3) Conclusion: This is where you wrap up your story and let readers know what you think about it.

How can innovation be used to improve businesses?
Innovation is a key element of business success. It can be used to improve businesses by providing new and unique solutions to problems, or by creating new ways to do business. There are several ways that innovation can be used in business, but some of the most common are: 
1. Innovation can help businesses increase sales and profits. When businesses use innovation to create new products or services that are more successful than those available before, they can make more money and achieve their goals more quickly.
2. Innovation can help businesses reduce costs. When businesses use innovation to come up with new ways to produce goods or services, they can save money on both production and marketing costs. This is especially important for small businesses, which may not have the resources or budget to spend on large-scale innovations. 
3. Innovation can help businesses improve customer service.
