Regulatory environment for innovation:
Innovation is one of the key drivers of economic growth and social progress. In an innovative regulatory environment, businesses can thrive while complying with norms and regulations. The right regulatory environment is essential for business to succeed, and innovation can happen easily in a healthy regulatory atmosphere. Here are four examples of how a vibrant innovation ecosystem can benefit businesses: 
1) Innovation occurs when companies are able to freely experiment with new products or services in order to find what works best for their customers. This helps them build better products, services, or processes that serve their customers better.
2) Innovation happens when regulators are willing to give companies the freedom they need to innovate. By allowing companies to test new ideas, they can identify which ones work and which don’t. This helps regulators ensure that innovative products and services are available for consumers as well as help businesses stay compliant with regulations.

3) densify the city
Densifying the city is one way to make it more livable and reduce its environmental impact. densify means break down a large area into smaller, more manageable parts.

There are many ways to densify a city, but some of the most popular methods include: increasing housing production, creating malls or shopping centers, increasing transportation options, and increasing employment opportunities. By implementing these ideas into your next municipal planning plan, you can help reduce the environmental impact of your city while keeping people living and enjoying their time in it.
