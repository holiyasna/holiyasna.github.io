What are the different types of ideas?
Ideas are everywhere. Whether it’s on a T-shirt, in your head, or on the internet, there are always new and innovative ways to approach problems and solve problems. 
There are many types of ideas, but here are three that stand out the most to me: 
1. The brainstorming method: This is a great way to come up with new ideas for products or services. Simply take some time and brainstorm all of the different options until you have a few that you like the best.
2. The problem/solution process: This is another great way to come up with new ideas for products or services. Once you have a few good ones, you can start working on solving the real world problems that they address.

What is creative art and why should you care?

There are many types of creative art, including photography, painting, poetry, sculpture, and music. Each artist creates their own unique brand of creative art.
There are several reasons why you should care about creative art. First, creative artists often use their own imagination and creativity to create new works of art.
