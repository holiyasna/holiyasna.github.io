What is brainstroming?
Are you finding it hard to focus on your work? Are you feeling overwhelmed by all the information you have to remember?

Brainstroming is a common problem and can lead to a loss of time and productivity. Here are some tips to help keep your mind active and focused: 
-Set specific goals for yourself and work towards them as closely as possible. This will help keep your focus on task and not onfailed goals. 
-Keep a positive attitude when working with new information. This will help prevent brainstroming and allow you to pay more attention to the task at hand. 
-Stay organized by creating lists of information, breaking down complex concepts into manageable chunks, and tracking progress.

The Idea: 1. What are some big ideas?
There are a few big ideas out there when it comes to starting a business. Here are some of the most prominent:
1. Start small and grow large. This is one of the most important things to remember when starting a business. You don't have to be the biggest or best in the world just start something and see where it takes you.
2. Be passionate about what you do. If you're not passionate about your work, no one else will be either. This is something that will come with time and experience, but start off by putting your all into your startup and showing people that you're really into it.
3. Have repeat customers/clients come back for more.
