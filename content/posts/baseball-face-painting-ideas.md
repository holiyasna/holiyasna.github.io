Creativity is a byproduct of many things, but one of the most important aspects is the ability to come up with new ideas. For many people, creativity comes from the feeling of not being able to put your finger on what you want. It can be hard to come up with a good idea when you don’t know what to ask for or what you want your product to be.

The downside of creativity
Creativity has been shown to have many benefits, both for individuals and society as a whole. However, there are also some potential downsides to being too creative.
For example, people who are very creative may be more likely to experience mental health problems such as anxiety and depression. This is because they are constantly thinking outside the box and questioning everything, which can lead to feeling overwhelmed and stressed out.

In addition, creative people may have a hard time fitting in with others. This is because they often see the world differently and have trouble relating to others who think more conventionally. As a result, they may feel like they don’t belong or are misunderstood.

While creativity has its advantages, it’s important to be aware of the potential drawbacks as well.
