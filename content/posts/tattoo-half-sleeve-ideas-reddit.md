Conclusion
Innovation has the ability to create new value for businesses and organizations, but it must be managed carefully in order to be successful. The process of innovation involves four distinct stages: ideation, development, commercialization, and scaling. Each stage presents its own challenges and opportunities, but the rewards can be great if innovation is managed effectively.
Organizations that innovate successfully tend to have a few key attributes in common. They are open to new ideas, willing to take risks, and have a culture that supports creativity and experimentation. They also have a clear understanding of their customers’ needs and how they can be met in new ways.

 Innovation is essential for businesses to thrive in today’s ever-changing marketplace. But it’s not enough to simply have good ideas – they must be executed well in order to create lasting value.

What is an invention?
There is no one definitive definition of an invention, but most Americans would likely say that an invention is a new product, process, or service.  Inventors often work on their inventions for years before they finally create a product or service that people can use. 
There are many different types of inventions, but some common ones include technological advances like the Telephone, Telegraph and Radio Act of 1847 (TCR), which gave us the ability to talk to each other over the air; and health advances such as aspirin and insulin in the 1800s. 

Inventions can have a profound impact on society and the economy. For example, TCR allowed for easier travel and communication across country boundaries. This made it possible for people from all corners of the world to meet and share ideas. Similarly, insulin helped people with diabetes control their medications more effectively.

Invention is the act of making something new, or the process of coming up with new ideas. It is often considered to be a creative act, one that involves coming up with something that has never been thought of before. Inventions can be small, like a new way to open a jar, or big, like a new type of engine. They can be simple, like a new way to tie a shoe, or complex, like a new computer system.
