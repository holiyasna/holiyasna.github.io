The power of creative ideas: How can they help your business or organization achieve success?
Creative ideas can help your business or organization achieve success in a variety of ways. By using creative ideas, you can increase the chances of success and create a more positive working environment. Here are six tips to help you find creative ideas that may be beneficial for your business or organization:
1. Allow yourself time to brainstorm. When you have an idea for a product or service, don’t immediately start creating prototypes. Give yourself time to think about it and come up with different options. This will help you get a better understanding of what the product or service can be and how it could be improved.

2. Talk to other businesses. Not all businesses are the same, so talking to other businesses will give you a better idea of what they’re doing and how they’ve been successful with their products or services.

legal aspects of Invention: What are the rules surrounding invention?
Invention is a process of coming up with a new idea,product or method. It can be defined in many ways, but the most common definition is that invention is "the creation of something new out of nothing." Many countries have laws that regulate the creation and use of inventions.

There are three types of law governing invention: trade secrets, copyrights and patents.trade secrets usually relate to technology or business ideas, while copyrights protect creative works such as novels, motion pictures and computer programs. Patents allow inventors to exclusive use their ideas for a period of time, which can make it difficult for other people to adopt or use an invention.
