what is innovation?
Innovation is a term used to describe the application of new ideas, methods or products. It includes both the process of creating new ideas and the implementation of those ideas into practice. Innovation is often used in business to refer to the process of introducing new products or services. However, it can also refer to improving existing products or services, as well as developing new processes or ways of doing things.
There are many different types of innovation, but all share a common goal: to create something new or improve upon something that already exists. The process of innovation typically begins with an idea. This can come from anywhere – an individual, a team, a company, or even a country. Once an idea has been generated, it must be developed and tested before it can be implemented. This process can take years, and sometimes even decades, to complete.

The benefits of brainstroming: What it is, how it works, and how to use it
Brainstroming, also known as “brainstorming,” is a process by which teams can come up with new ideas and strategies faster and more easily than when they are spread out among individuals. Brainstroming can be used in business, engineering, marketing, and many other areas of work. Here are three reasons why brainstroming is important: 
1. Brainstroming can help you come up with Faster Ideas: When you brainstorm with others, you may end up coming up with concepts that are different from what was initially proposed. This allows you to be more creative and efficient when it comes to coming up with solutions. 
2. Brainstroming Can Help You Come Up With Moreorthern Ideas: When team members brainstorm together, they often come up with ideas that are outside the scope of the original proposal.
