What are big ideas?
There are many big ideas in the world, but what makes a good idea? This question is difficult to answer, as there is no one right answer. However, some tips on how to make an idea into a successful business venture can help. 1) Start with a small goal: What are your main goals for the business? Once you have a solid goal, it is easier to develop a plan and execute on it. 2) Be realistic: Don’t expect your business to be anything great right away.
