Definition of innovation: How does it differ from other types of innovation?
Innovation is the process of coming up with new, better ways to do something. It can come from ideas, research, and development (R&D), or even from manufacturing or design. Innovation is often different than other types of innovation, such as creativity or efficiency.
Creativity is the process of coming up with new ideas that are different from what has been done before. It can come from brainstorming and poking around in your own mind, or from talking to others about what they have come up with. Innovation also comes from seeing things in a new way, whether it’s when you come up with a new product idea or when you fix an old one.

Discussion: Are any of the new ideas feasible or even desirable?
Do any of the new ideas proposed in a new white paper by Google and The New York Times hold promise for improving American society? If so, why are they being considered so cautiously?
Critics say that some of the proposals - such as creating a government-sponsored healthcare system - would be too costly or even unrealistic. Others worry that none of the new ideas will work.

But if a few potential solutions can be put into practice, they may well constitute a more effective way to improve the quality of life for Americans. So far, there is no clear evidence that any of these proposals have actually changed people's lives in meaningful ways.
