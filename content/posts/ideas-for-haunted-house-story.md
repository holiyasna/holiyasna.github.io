Research: How to research your invention idea
If you have an invention idea, you may be wondering how to research it. There are a few ways to do this:
1. Talk to people who might use your invention. Ask them what they think of your idea, and whether they would be interested in using it.

2. Look for similar products that already exist. See how well they work and what kind of feedback they get from users.

3. Do a patent search to see if anyone has already patented a similar idea.

4. Talk to experts in the field, such as engineers or scientists, to get their opinion on your idea.

5. Make a prototype of your invention and test it out yourself. See how well it works and get feedback from people who use it.
