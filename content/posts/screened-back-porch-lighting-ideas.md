Conclusion: the importance of invention
Invention is the key to progress. It is the engine of change. It drives economies and creates new industries.
Invention is important because it leads to progress. Progress is defined as a forward or onward movement toward a destination. It is the opposite of regression, or a return to a previous state. In order for there to be progress, there must be invention. Invention leads to progress by creating new products, processes, or services that are more efficient than the existing ones.
