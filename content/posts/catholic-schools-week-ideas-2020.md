Conclusion:
Creative art doesn't have to be expensive or time-consuming. There are many ways to create beautiful pieces of art without much effort. Here are three simple tips: 
1) Start with a basic idea. What are your favorite pieces of art and why? How can you improve on them without having to spend a lot of money? 
2) Use your creativity. Take advantage of what you know about your subject matter. If you're an artist, you know how to paint! Why not use that knowledge to make something new and interesting? 
3) Experiment. Change things up until you find something that works well for you. Be creative and open-minded; it'll make the process more fun and fulfilling!
