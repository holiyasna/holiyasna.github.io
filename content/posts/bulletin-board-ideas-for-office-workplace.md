Underlying drivers of innovation: The need for new information, technology, or business models
Innovation is what makes businesses and societies successful. It allows for new products, services, or ideas to be developed and offered to the public. However, without innovation, businesses can quickly lose their competitive edge and society can become more stagnant. There are several underlying drivers of innovation that must be considered if we want to see continued success for our industries and societies.
New information technology is vital for businesses in order to increase efficiency and innovate faster. Technologies like chatbots and AI have the potential to change how customers interact with businesses, making them more likely to choose a business over another option. By increasing efficiency and reducing customer friction, businesses can sell more products and services at a lower cost.

Citation: How should an inventor be cited?
An inventor should be cited when creating or referencing a work in any form, whether it be in an academic article, book, thesis, or patent application. Citing an inventor correctly can improve the accuracy and legibility of your work, as well as prevent others from plagiarizing your invention. To properly cite an inventor, follow these simple steps:
1. Identify the inventor(s) responsible for your invention. This can be done by finding their name and contact information on patents or other sources that list inventors.

2. Research the specific invention you are referencing to try to determine which author wrote about that invention specifically. If you're referencing a work written by several authors, it's often helpful to identify which author wrote about each innovation in order to better understand how they could have been cited for this particular innovation.
