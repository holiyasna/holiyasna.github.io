Types of creativity: There are three types of creativity: Play, Discovery, and Invention.
Creativity is a wide term and can mean many different things to different people. To some, creativity means coming up with new ideas or concepts. To others, it refers to the act of creating something from nothing.
Invention involves coming up with a solution to a problem or completing an unfinished task. Play is another form of creativity where people are focused on experiencing new experiences and having fun.

All three types of creativity can have positive and negative effects on individuals and businesses alike. If you're looking for ways to increase your creativity, it's important to understand the reasons behind each type and how they can be used in your work environment.

Inspiration from nature:
Creative ideas come from all around nature. Sometimes they are simple, like a flower that can be picked up with your hands, or an animal that is easy to look at but hard to understand. Other times they are more complicated, like the way a tree grows or the way a bee collects nectar. Whatever creative ideas you come up with, make sure they are based on something you have seen in nature and that you can understand.
