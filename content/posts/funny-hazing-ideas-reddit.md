When it comes to innovation, there are a few things that always seem to set a company apart from the rest. Perhaps the most well-known example is Silicon Valley’s “technology shock,” where innovative new technologies emerged suddenly and explosively in the early 1960s. At other times, companies can be credited for developing innovative products or services over time, such as Levi Strauss and Co.'s jeans becoming popular after they were first developed in the 1800s.

Invention: How did one person come up with an idea that led to a new product or technology?
An inventor is someone who comes up with an idea for a new product or technology. It can be something as simple as coming up with a new way to cook food, or inventing a new alloy that can be used in metalworking. In some cases, an inventor may develop the idea while working on another project, and then take it further by working on the details until they come up with a product or technology that they think will be useful. Some inventors are also able to come up with ideas while they are away from their home country, or during off-hours at work.

Customer Loyalty: What is customer loyalty and how can it be increased in your business?
Customer loyalty is one of the most important aspects of a business. It is the basis for why people are customers and how they can be continued to be customers. Loyalty is increased when businesses provide value, implement change, and are responsive to customer needs. Here are three new ideas for increasing customer loyalty in your business:
1. Offer more value to customers: When you offer more value to customers, they will become more loyal. This can be done by adding features or services that are not currently available or by reducing prices. By doing this, you will create an emotional connection with your customers and increase their loyalty.

2. Change with the times: When you keep up with the latest trends in your industry, you will increase your chances of being a successful business.
