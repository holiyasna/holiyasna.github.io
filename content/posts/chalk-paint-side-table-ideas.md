What is Invention?
Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea or design. Innovation is key to businesses and societies, both here in the United States and around the world. And while it can come from any form of creativity-from simple change to groundbreaking technology-invention has a special history and meaning in America.
It was on July 14, 1776, when Continental Congress passed the Declaration of Independence, which declared that each state was an independent nation with its own rights and destiny. Inventions dating back to ancient Greece and Rome had helped make these ideas a reality. But what made America unique? The answer lies in its history of innovation, not just as a country but also as a place where people from all walks of life could come together to share their ideas and dreams.

Innovation is at the heart of American identity.

The benefits of brainstorming
When it comes to generating new ideas, brainstorming is one of the most effective tools at our disposal. By bringing together a diverse group of people and encouraging them to think creatively, we can come up with solutions to problems that might otherwise seem insurmountable.

1. It encourages creativity: By stimulating the creative part of our brain, brainstorming can help us come up with ideas that we wouldn’t have thought of on our own.

2. It helps us find new solutions to old problems: By looking at problems from a different perspective, we can often find new and innovative solutions that we would never have thought of before.
