Conclusion: Some things to consider before you come up with new ideas.
When you come up with new ideas, it's important to consider what the idea means to you. Do you think it will help solve a problem? Are there other ideas out there that could work better? If so, why not go for it? However, if the answer is no and the idea isn't something that excites or interests you, don't go ahead and try it. There are a lot of great ideas out there and sometimes the best thing to do is just give up.

The creative process: How does the creative process work?
Creative ideas come to life when artists and writers share their thoughts, feelings and experiences with one another. The creative process begins with inspiration, which is the first step in developing a creative idea. Next, the artist or writer must come up with a unique concept that will capture the attention of others. Once the idea has been captured, it‚Äôs time for the writer or artist to flesh out the idea into a full-blown story or novel. Finally, unless there‚Äôs an incredible lucky streak, every book or story has to be well-researched and Fallon writes about creating new ideas on a daily basis - whether that‚Äôs coming up with an original character or imagining what might happen if she were ever given the opportunity to work on a project her own choosing.
