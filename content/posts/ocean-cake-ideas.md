Definition: Creative art is any form of art that is not based on literal or historical reality.
Creative art is any form of art that is not based on literal or historical reality. This includes both expressively creative art and abstraction. Expressively creative art often uses creativity to escape from reality. An example of this would be a painting that doesn't represent a real-world object, but instead usesimagery or myth to create a unique experience. An example of an abstract artist's work could be a painting without any specific objects or movements, allowing the viewer to imagine what it might look like.

Conclusion: Ideas are important, but they can also be dangerous.
Ideas can be dangerous if not taken seriously. Too often, people forget that ideas can have a real impact on the world. When it comes to creating meaningful change, it’s important to remember that ideas are just that-ideas. Sometimes they can be powerful and effective, while other times they can be disastrous. The key is to balance the potential power of an idea with the potential danger it may cause.

Winter weather: Tips to keep your home warm
If you're like most people, you probably think of winter as the time when your house is cold and unused. But that's not always the case. In fact, there are a few things you can do to keep your home warm during the winter. Here are some tips:
1) Keep your windows open at all times. This will let in natural sunlight, which will help keep your home warm.
2) Use a fireplace or heat pad. Fires add warmth to any space, and they also emit noxious gases which can help block out wind noise and cold air from coming in.
3) Place an electric blanket over every piece of furniture in your room. This will place an electric field between yourself and the elements, which will help keep you warm (or cooler) during the winter months.
