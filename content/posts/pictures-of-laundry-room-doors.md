Different Types of Creativity: Why does one type work better than another?
Creativity is a complex and subjective thing. There are many factors that influence it. One of the most important ones is creativity's ability to imagine new things. One type of creativity, called brainstorming, is often used in creative workflows. It allows people to generate new ideas and concepts rapidly. But there are other types of creativity as well, so why does one work better than another?

Overcoming creative blocks: what to do when you can't think of anything
When you feel like you can't think of anything, it can be frustrating. But there are ways to overcome creative blocks. Here are a few ideas: 
1. Take a break: Sometimes when you feel like you can't think of anything, it's because you've been thinking too hard. Step away from your work and take a break. Go for a walk, watch a movie, or read a book. Once you take your mind off of your project, you may find that the ideas start flowing again.

2. Talk to someone: When you're feeling stuck, talking to someone else can give you some fresh perspective. Brainstorm with a friend or colleague. They may have some ideas that you hadn't thought of before.
