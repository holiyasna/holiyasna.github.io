Risks and Opportunities of Innovation
Innovation is one of the most important aspects of any business. It can bring new ideas and products to market, which in turn can save businesses money and increase sales. However, there are always potential risks associated with innovation. For example, innovation can lead to new technologies that are unproven or difficult to use, which could lead to errors or failures. Additionally, innovation can also lead to companies becoming too reliant on outside sources for their products or services, which could create conflicts of interest or problems with partner relationships.

Origin of invention: Why was a particular invention chosen for development?
Inventions are often chosen for development based on a number of factors, including need, potential market, and other costs. There is an Origin of Invention story to be told every time a new invention is created. The story begins with the idea and then the process that went into making it a reality. 
Some inventions are born out of necessity; others come from pure thought. Sometimes, an idea just pops into someone's head and they start to see how it could be used in the real world. Other times, a team of experts put their thoughts together and come up with a great solution or innovation. 

The Origin of Invention story isn't always about bricks and mortar. Sometimes, ideas just take off in different directions after being studied and tested in various settings.

Creative people are often seen as those who come up with new ideas and solutions to problems. They are also often seen as those who are able to see things in a new light. Although creativity is often seen as a good thing, it can also be destructive. For example, a person who is creative may come up with a new plan that does not work, or they may come up with a solution to a problem that does not work.
