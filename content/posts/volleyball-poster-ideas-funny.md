what is brainstorming?
Brainstorming is a group activity in which members of a team generate ideas and solutions to problems. The term was first coined by Alex Osborn, an advertising executive, in the 1940s. Brainstorming is often used in business settings as a way to encourage creativity and out-of-the-box thinking. 
There are several different methods of brainstorming, but the most common is probably the round robin method, in which each team member takes turns sharing ideas. Other methods include free association, in which participants share ideas without restriction, and brainstorming with constraints, in which participants are given certain parameters within which to generate ideas. 

The effectiveness of brainstorming has been debated by some researchers, who argue that it can lead to conformity and pressure to conform to group norms.

Conclusion: the importance of creativity in our lives
When it comes to creativity, we often think of artistic pursuits like painting or writing.  However, creativity is so much more than that. Itâ€™s about thinking outside the box, coming up with new ideas and solutions, and looking at the world in a different way.
In our fast-paced, constantly changing world, creativity is more important than ever. We need to be able to adapt and come up with new ideas to solve problems. If we get stuck in the same way of thinking, weâ€™ll never progress.

So next time youâ€™re feeling stuck, donâ€™t give up. Take a step back and look at the situation from a different perspective. You never know what creative solution you might come up with.
