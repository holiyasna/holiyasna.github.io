The different types of creativity: Imagination, Invention, Create, and Expression.
Creativity is an important factor in any business or creative endeavor. It can come in the form of ideas, creativity, and expression. Creative individuals can be found in all walks of life, but there are key differences between creativity and invention. Invention is the creation of something new, while creativity comes from having an original idea that doesnâ€™t already exist. Expression is how a creative idea is put into action and can be seen in everything from fashion to art to music.

How can you come up with ideas quickly and easily?
There are a few things you can do to come up with quick and easy ideas. One is to brainstorm with others, and try to come up with ideas that everyone can find common ground on. Another is to jot down a few ideas on paper, so that when you have more time, you can work on those ideas in more detail. Finally, keep a notebook around where you can jot down any new thoughts or concepts that come over your head.
