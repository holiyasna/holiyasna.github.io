What are some new ideas?
Some new ideas for healthy eating come in all shapes and sizes. Some people might just want to start incorporating more fruits and vegetables into their diets, while others might prefer whole grains or proteins. Whatever your preference, here are five healthy ideas to get you started: 
1) Try a plant-based protein shake instead of meat or chicken protein. Plant-based proteins are high in fiber and nutrients, which can help you feel fuller longer. 
2) Eat more vegetables and fruit as part of your breakfast and lunch. Vegetables contain seeds, which is a good source of fiber and other nutrients. When you eat them early in the morning or before lunch, you’re less likely to feel hungry later in the day. 
3) Make sure to add watercress to your diet whenever possible.

What are big ideas?
Big Ideas are ideas that are so large, they can't be crammed into a small amount of time. They can take up a lot of thought and effort, but they have the potential to change the world. Here are some examples of big ideas:
1. A universal basic income. This is an idea that has been around for years, but it is still not widely accepted. It would be money that is given to everyone regardless of their income, so it would not depend on fertility rates or any other factors.

2. Education reform. Education is one of the most important aspects of our society and economy, and it needs to be improved in order to make sure everyone can get the education they need.
