How Invention began
Invention is a process of creating something new and often involving the use of an unknown or unusual tool. Many inventions have originated from the simplest concepts, such as a design for a shirt that was first conceived by a tailor. Other inventions, like the transistor, were created through years of trial and error before they were finally realized in devices such as radios and TVs. Inventions can be so important to our society that they are often consideredtreasures, and some have even been donated to universities or used in scientific research.
