A pedometer tracks steps taken and the number of calories burned, which can be helpful in understanding how much exercise you're doing and how much weight you've lost. Another common way to track fitness progress is to use a Garminbrace. This tracking device records your physical activity data and stores it on a computer.

Creative ideas can be anything from new products to new ways of serving food. Sometimes, the best ideas come when you’re not sure what to do. That’s why it’s so important to have a few ideas ready when you need them, and to keep track of what you think is potential. When you have a few ideas, it’s easier to come up with something that works and that someone will want.
