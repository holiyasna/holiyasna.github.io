Concepts behind plot and story: What are the elements of a good story?
Plot is the story's backbone, and without a plot, stories are essentially empty vessels. Storytelling has been around for centuries, and there are dozens of different concepts that contribute to a good story. Here are a few key ones:
1) Characters: What makes a good character? Is he or she likable, believable, and relatable? Are they in control of their own lives and choices? Are they interesting enough to follow along with the story?

2) Plot: How does the story go from start to finish? Is it chronological, or does it go in reverse or hops around like an L.A. law student on a bender? Are there any side stories that play into the main plotline? And how important is the climax/ending to the story?

Conclusion: What advice would you give to someone interested in the future of technology?
There are a few things that anyone interested in the future of technology should keep in mind. One is to always be open to new ideas, and another is to think about what could happen if we don't take steps to improve the world around us. Here are a few ideas for future technology that might help address some of the problems we're seeing today: 
-Virtual Reality: This could be used for training or for real-world applications such as medical surgery. It's already being used in games and allows users to feel as if they are within the game or the application itself. 

-Augmented Reality: This allows users to see what they're looking at with more detail than ever before. Augmented Reality can also be used for marketing purposes, since it can give people an idea of what products they might want to buy.
