What are some creative ideas?
Creative ideas are everything. Whether you’re looking to come up with new ways to market your business, come up with unique and original designs for your home or just need a creative brainstorm, there’s no shortage of ideas available. Here are five creative ideas that can help get you started:
1. Create a social media account and share your latest projects and progress on Twitter and Instagram. This will let other creatives know what you’re up to, and it can also be used as an opportunity to show off your work in a more public way.

2. Collaborate with fellow entrepreneurs and investors in order to develop a business plan or strategy. This will help you understand where your business is headed, as well as give you some idea of what kind of investment resources might be available to you.

what is brainstorming?
Brainstorming is a group activity in which members of a team generate ideas and solutions to problems. The term was first coined by Alex Osborn, an advertising executive, in the 1940s. Brainstorming is often used in business settings as a way to encourage creativity and out-of-the-box thinking. 
There are several different methods of brainstorming, but the most common is probably the round robin method, in which each team member takes turns sharing ideas. Other methods include free association, in which participants share ideas without restriction, and brainstorming with constraints, in which participants are given certain parameters within which to generate ideas. 

The effectiveness of brainstorming has been debated by some researchers, who argue that it can lead to conformity and pressure to conform to group norms.

The Process of Idea Generation: How do you come up with ideas?
Ideas are important, because they can help you bring about changes in your life or in the lives of others. However, it can be tough to come up with ideas. There are a few key factors that can help you generate more ideas. The first is to have a clear understanding of what you want to achieve. If you don’t know what you want, it’s hard to come up with ideas for it. The second factor is to be persistent. If you start thinking about something and not doing anything about it, the likelihood of carrying out your idea will increase. The third factor is to have a great idea. This requires both creativity and originality. If an idea is well-developed but not original, others may be more likely to adopt it. Lastly, make sure your idea is feasible.
