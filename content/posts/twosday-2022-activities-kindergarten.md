Invention: What are the different types of inventions?
Invention refers to any new or unique product, service, process, or technology that is developed by an individual. This can be in the form of a new way to do something, a new recipe for a food, or a new way of looking at an issue. There are many different types of inventions and each has its own story and importance. Here are five of the most common:
1. Technology- A technological invention is any new invention that makes something easier or more efficient. For example, one example of a technological innovation is the development of vacuum cleaners that don't require electricity to work.

2. Food- Many inventions are based on recipes that have been around for centuries. For example, the crockpot was invented by accident when someone found out that cooking meat in a slow cooker couldn't get it to brown as well as they wanted it to.
