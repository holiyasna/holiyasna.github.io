Contributions of invention: What has been done with invention that has changed the world?
Invention has had a profound impact on the world, from the creation of dishes that could be made without cookbooks to modern surgical tools and vehicles. Some inventions have even saved lives, such as the polio vaccine. In recent years, however, there has been a surge in innovation in the field of invention, with new ideas coming out all the time. Here are some of the most innovative inventions of all time:
1) The first electronic device was created in 1861 by George Stephenson and James Clerk Maxwell. This was known as the Manchester Electrician's Watch. It was used to tell time and helped people stay healthy during health epidemics like bubonic plague.

2) Invention of combustion engine in 1879 by John Fenton and Arthur Couch. This allowed cars to be driven on paved roads instead of being pulled by horses or carts.
