The Creative Process: How do you come up with creative ideas?
Creative ideas come to us in all shapes and sizes. Sometimes they are easy to come by, and other times they require a bit of effort but can be really rewarding. Here are some tips on how to come up with creative ideas:
1. Brainstorm with others: When brainstorming, always consider what others might have in mind. Talk to your friends, family, co-workers, or even strangers about the idea you’re thinking of and see if anyone has any ideas that might work better.

2. Take a step back: Once you’ve come up with an idea, it can be helpful to take a step back and look at it from a different perspective. This will help you think about ways to make it more effective or unique.
