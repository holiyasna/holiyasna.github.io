Factors that influence the definition of a big idea
There are many factors that can influence the definition of a big idea. Some of these include the idea's popularity, its feasibility, and its novelty. Popularity is important because it can help to determine whether or not people are interested in the idea. Feasibility is important because it determines how easily the idea can be implemented. Its feasibility will also depend on whether or not someone has an understanding of the concept. Finally, novelty is important because it can change people's opinions on an issue. This can lead to a change in the way people think about the idea and potential implementation.

Definition of Innovation: Ideas that improve the quality, efficiency, or effectiveness of life
Innovation is the process of developing a new product, service, or idea that improves quality, efficiency, or effectiveness. Innovation ideas can be specific to a certain industry or field, but they also have the potential to be applied to any area of life. 
One example of an innovation that has been implemented successfully in many industries is the automobile. The development and implementation of efficient and effective car engines has led to increased speeds and efficiency on the road. Another example is the internet. The early days were difficult for website designers because no one had a clear definition of what “web design” meant. However, as technology evolved and more people became comfortable using computers, websites started popping up all over the place. As a result, web design has become one of the most popular areas for innovation today.

The definition of creativity
What is creativity? Many people have different definitions for creativity. Some say that it is when you come up with new and original ideas, while others define it as the ability to think outside the box and come up with solutions to problems.
Creativity can be defined as the ability to generate new and innovative ideas. It is often seen as a process of problem solving, where you take existing knowledge and use it in new and unique ways. Creativity is often associated with artistry and design, but it can also be found in other areas such as business, science, and technology.

There are many ways to encourage creativity. One way is to provide opportunities for people to work on creative projects together. This can help them to come up with new ideas and solutions by bouncing ideas off of each other.
