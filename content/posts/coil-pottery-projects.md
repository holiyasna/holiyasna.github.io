Printing press
In 1439, Johannes Gutenberg invented the printing press, which revolutionized how information was disseminated. For the first time in history, knowledge was not restricted to those who could read and write; it could be shared with anyone who could operate a printing press. The ability to mass-produce printed materials quickly and cheaply made it possible for people to access a wide range of information that was previously only available to a select few.
The invention of the printing press had a profound impact on society. It allowed for the rapid spread of ideas and knowledge, and played a key role in shaping the course of history. Today, the printing press is an essential tool for businesses, schools, and individuals around the world.

The history of brainstorming
Few things in business are as essential as brainstorming. Whether you’re a team of two or a multinational corporation, being able to come up with new ideas is the key to success. But where did this process come from? How did it evolve into the powerhouse it is today?
The origins of brainstorming can be traced back to the early 1900s. American engineer Alex Osborn was looking for a way to increase creativity and productivity in his advertising agency. He came up with a simple but effective solution: get a group of people together in a room and have them bounce ideas off each other. Osborn called this process “brainstorming” and it quickly caught on.

Since then, brainstorming has undergone something of a renaissance.
