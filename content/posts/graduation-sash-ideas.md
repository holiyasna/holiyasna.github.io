Why are big ideas so important?
Big ideas are the foundation of any great idea, and they can be a driving force behind your innovation. Here are five reasons why big ideas are so important:
1. They build on those that have been done before. A big idea is always new and original, making it easier to come up with new and innovative ideas. This makes it harder for others to copy, which in turn allows you to rest assured that your product or service will be successful.

2. They can help you focus on the right things. When you have a large number of big ideas circling around your head, it can be difficult to know where to start and what to focus on. By having a few big ideas at the forefront of your mind, you can more easily stay focused on what’s important and get the job done rather than trying too many things at once.
