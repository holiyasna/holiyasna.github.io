What challenges must be overcome in order to create successful inventions?
Inventions have the potential to change the way people live and work. But while they hold great potential, they also have a large challenge of overcoming many obstacles in order to be successful. One obstacle is the lack of understanding and knowledge about the inventor's process and how their invention can be used in the world. Another obstacle is the cost of patenting an invention. These costs can range from $1 million to $30 million, making them very prohibitive for many businesses. In order to overcome these challenges, businesses must develop a clear idea of what they are trying to achieve with their invention, as well as how it can be used in the world. This will help them come up with ideas that are both successful and affordable.

Requirements for innovation
Innovation is essential to the success of businesses and societies. However, some challenges companies face when it comes to innovation include:
-Lack of creativity: Many companies find it difficult to come up with new ideas. This is due in part to the rigid methods that are typically used in business. For example, most businesses have a traditional model where products are produced one after the other. This system limits the potential for creativity and producesfewer new ideas.

-Disruption: When a new idea comes along, many companies are hesitant to adopt it because they think it would be too expensive or hard to replicate. However, disruption is often what allows businesses to take risks and innovate new models.
