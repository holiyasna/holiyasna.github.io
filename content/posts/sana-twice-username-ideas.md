Why do you think your ideas are interesting?
Ideas are the fuel that drives creativity. They can be used to come up with new ideas, or to develop an existing idea into something better. There are a few things you need to do in order to make your ideas stand out from the rest:
1. Make sure your ideas are well-conceptualized and engaging. This means having a clear idea of what you want your product or service to do, and making sure it is interesting enough for people to want to try it.

2. Be clear about what your target audience is. If your idea is for a new product, make sure you know who your target market is, and how you plan on reaching them. This will help you focus on the right things when developing your pitch.

3. Use effective marketing techniques to market your idea.

Ideas for Creativity: What works and what doesn’t
Creativity is all about coming up with new and innovative ideas. However, it can be difficult to know what works and what doesn't. Here are some ideas for creativity that may work for you: 
1. Keep a journal or diary to help you keep track of your ideas and progress. This can be a great way to tape your thoughts and ideas together so that you can revisit them later on. 
2. Use creative software such as Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator to create digital illustrations, designs, or logos. These tools allow you to take your ideas and turn them into reality! 
3. Take on challenging projects that will force you to rethink your methods and strategies. This can include working on projects that are outside of your comfort zone, submitting original work to competitions, or simply trying something new once again!
