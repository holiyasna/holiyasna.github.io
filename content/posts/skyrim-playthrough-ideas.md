Air Quality Issues in Your Home: Some tips for improving air quality in your home.
If you're like most people, you probably take air quality seriously when it comes to your home. You might think about greening your home, getting a air purifier, or even simply getting a better air quality index rating. However, there are other ways to improve air quality in your home as well – some of which are easy and can be done without too much effort. Here are a few tips for improving air quality in your home: 
1) Make sure your windows are properly sealed. Poorly sealed windows allow harmful particles from the outside into the house and can cause respiratory problems.

2) Get a good air purifier. Air purifiers can help clean the air around you and reduce the amount of unhealthy ozone gas that is created by car engines and other sources.

3) Use proper ventilation!

Regardless of its intended use, creative art relies on the creativity of the artist and the ability to think outside the box.
