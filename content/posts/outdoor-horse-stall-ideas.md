There is something about brains that make them so fascinating. While we can't understand every single neuron in our brain, we can study how they work and how they are related to one another. This research has led to the discovery of brainstroming - a type of thinking that occurs when two or more thoughts are working together in your mind and you don't know which one to focus on.

What are some common creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be anything from new ways of looking at an old problem to reinventing the wheel. Here are five creative ideas that come to mind when thinking about creative ideas: 
1. Use discarded materials to create something new. For example, if you have a bunch of old cereal boxes lying around, go through them and discard any that are too large or bulky to use. Once you’ve eliminated the big ones, start stacking these in different positions to see what kind of shapes and designs emerge.
2. Try a new approach to an existing idea. If you’ve been using the same recipe for years, try using a different type of flour or sugar in your baking recipes. This will give your baking recipes a bit of a fresh start and make them more delicious overall.
3. Take advantage of unused space.

What is the creation process like?
Invention ideas are something that often come to people by surprises. They may be something that someone has been thinking about, or something that they were inspired by. The creation process is a crucial part of any invention, and can play a major role in how successful the invention is. There are many different steps involved in the creation process, and each one has its own importance. 
The first step is always brainstorming. This can be done either before or after the idea has been finalized. It is important to get rid of any bad ideas before they become a part of the product. This will help to make sure that the product is truly unique and innovative. Once an idea has been brainstormed, it needs to be tested. This can be done in many ways, but the most important part is to find a way that the product can be used in reality.
