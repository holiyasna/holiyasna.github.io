creating a plan: What are some steps you need to take in order to create a successful idea?
Creative ideas can be a huge asset to any business. However, they can also be extremely difficult to come by. In order to create a successful idea, you need to take some key steps.

This will help you come up with a great plan and ideas for what to pursue. 2. Diversification- If your idea is focused only on one market or industry, it will likely not be successful.
