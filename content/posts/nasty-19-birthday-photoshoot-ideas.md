What is brainstroming and how does it work?
There is a lot of debate surrounding the term brainstroming. What is it? And how does it work? The answer to both questions is that brainstroming occurs when people are unfocused or processor-locked. This can lead to a lack of focus and an inability to process information. Itâ€™s often difficult to know where to turn or what to do next, which can result in a feeling of emptiness or hopelessness.
Brainstroming is typically accompanied by feelings of helplessness and confusion. People may feel like they donâ€™t have any control over their lives and they donâ€™t know what to do next. This can be a difficult time for both the person with brainstroming and those around them. Itâ€™s important for those with brainstroming to seek help if they feel lost or hopeless.
