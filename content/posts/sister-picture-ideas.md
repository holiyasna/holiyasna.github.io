Definition: Innovation is the process by which a new idea, product, or service is created.
definition of innovation
One of the key concepts in innovation is the definition of what it is. Innovation can be defined as the process by which a new idea, product, or service is created. This definition could be used to describe many different aspects of innovation, but some are more important than others. For example, innovation can be used to describe the process by which new products are created, or the process by which new ideas are developed.

There are a few different ways to achieve innovation. One way is to brainstorm new ideas and see if anyone has any that you think could work well. Another way is to test out products or services before they're released to see if they work well and if there's enough demand for them. There's also the option of learning from experts and watching them create innovative products or services.

Why do we have them?: how do they originate?
Most of us have had ideas. Some of us have had great ideas, others less so. But where do these ideas come from? How do they originate?
Ideas can come from anywhere and everywhere. They can come from our own minds, or from the minds of other people. They can come from books, movies, or even just casual conversations.

Ideas can also originate from our experiences. We might have a new idea after experiencing something for the first time, or after seeing someone else experience it. Or we might have an idea that comes to us in a dream.

There is no one answer to where ideas come from. They can come from anywhere and anyone. The important thing is what we do with them once we have them.
