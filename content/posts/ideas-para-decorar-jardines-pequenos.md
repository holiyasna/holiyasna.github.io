How to be a better artist: Tips and techniques from experienced artists
Creative art is a process of creating things that are not generally found in the normal world. Artists must use their creativity to come up with new ideas and concepts, and then put them into practice on canvas or paper. There are many ways to become a better artist, and there are plenty of resources available to help you along the way. Here are some tips from experienced artists to help you get started: 
1. Find a creative outlet for your creative impulses. One way to be more creative is by spending time in your own home or office, without any distractions. This will allow you to work on things that interest you without any pressure from others. 
2. Use constructive criticism as a learning tool. If you’re not sure how something looks or isn’t working, ask someone else for feedback.
