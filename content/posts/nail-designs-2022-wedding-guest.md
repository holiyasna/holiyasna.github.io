what is innovation?
Innovation is a term used to describe the application of new ideas, methods or products. It includes both the process of creating new ideas and the implementation of those ideas into practice. Innovation is often used in business to refer to the process of introducing new products or services. However, it can also refer to improving existing products or services, as well as developing new processes or ways of doing things.
There are many different types of innovation, but all share a common goal: to create something new or improve upon something that already exists. The process of innovation typically begins with an idea. This can come from anywhere – an individual, a team, a company, or even a country. Once an idea has been generated, it must be developed and tested before it can be implemented. This process can take years, and sometimes even decades, to complete.

Conclusion: What are the benefits of creativity in art?
Creativity has been shown to be a valuable trait in art, with many benefits for both the artist and the audience. Some of these benefits include:
1. Increased creativity and productivity – When artists are able to use their creativity to come up with new ideas, they are usually more productive overall. This can free up time for them to work on other projects, which can then lead to increased sales and better profits.

2. More interesting and engaging artwork – One of the biggest benefits of creativity is that it can help break down barriers between different disciplines and make art more engaging for both audiences. This can lead to more people becoming interested in watching or reading art, which can have a positive impact on financial success.
