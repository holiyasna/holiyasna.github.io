How to Take Advantage of Ideas: How can you take advantage of ideas?
Ideas are a powerful tool for businesses and people. They can help you solve problems, get ideas for new products or services, and come up with new ways of doing things. However, taking advantage of ideas can be difficult. Here are four tips to help you make the most of your ideas: 
1. Make sure you have an idea for what you want to create. If you don't have an idea for what you want to do, it won't be easy to come up with a great way to put your idea into practice. 
2. Do your research before starting something. Once you have an idea for something, it's important to do some research so that you're not wasting time and money on something that doesn't have a lot of potential. 
3. Be patient.

The challenges of big ideas: What can prevent them from becoming successful?
When it comes to big ideas, sometimes the obstacles are simply too great. When it comes to innovation, often times what's required is a willingness to take on new challenges and risk everything for the sake of something better. But in some cases, taking such risks can actually backfire, leading to less innovation and more stagnation. Here are six examples of how big ideas can fail:
1) Failing to appreciate the uniqueness of each idea

One of the biggest challenges faced by big ideas is that they often come from unique perspectives or points of view. This can be difficult to take on and even harder to understand, let alone replicate.
