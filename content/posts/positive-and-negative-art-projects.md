properties of innovation:
Innovation is a process of change that occurs when a new idea, product or service becomes more popular than the existing ones. Innovation can be seen as an exciting opportunity for businesses to create new products and services that improve their customers’ lives. The key to success in innovation is to have a strong vision and plan for the innovation, which can be difficult if the business does not have enough resources or if it does not have the rightpeople on board.
Innovation is often associated with technological progress, but it can also take place in other industries such as architecture and engineering. In architecture, innovation can take place in the design of buildings and infrastructure, as well as in the development of new technologies and marketing strategies.

Invention: What are its different forms?
Invention is the process of creating something new, whether it is a new product or a new method of doing something. Inventions often differ in form, but they all share one common goal: to improve society. There are many different types of inventions, but the most common are products and methods. Product inventions are those that make something better than what was before, while method inventions involve coming up with a new way to do something. As technology advances, so too will the variety of invention potential. But no matter what type of invention you come up with, there is always a potential for improvement.
