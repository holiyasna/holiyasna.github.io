The power of a big idea: can change the way we think and see the world
Big ideas have the power to change the way we think and see the world. They can challenge our assumptions and help us to see things in new ways.


For example, the big idea of evolution has helped us to understand the diversity of life on Earth and our place in the natural world. The big idea of gravity has helped us to understand how the universe works. And the big idea of relativity has helped us to understand the nature of time and space.



Big ideas can also change the way we see ourselves and our place in the world. The big idea of human rights, for example, has helped us to understand that all people are equal and deserving of respect. The big idea of democracy has helped us to understand that everyone should have a say in how they are governed.



So what is your big idea?

Why do people often have big ideas?
There is no one answer to this question, as people come up with big ideas for different reasons. Some people may have big ideas because they are passionate about something, or they think that their idea could make a significant impact. Other people may have big ideas because they feel like they have a great idea, but they need to turn it into a reality. In either case, having a big idea is important because it can help you focus and take on new challenges.
