Define brainstorming.
Brainstorming is a process that allows you to generate ideas and solutions by working with a group. The goal of brainstorming is to come up with as many ideas as possible, without judging or evaluating them. This can be done by writing down all the ideas that come to mind, or by using a technique called "brainstorming." Brainstorming is a technique that is used to generate new ideas by thinking creatively about a problem or issue. The key to effective brainstorming is to suspend judgment and allow the free flow of ideas.

The role of innovation in business:
Innovation is a key component of business success. It allows businesses to change and improve their products, services and processes in order to meet customer needs. However, innovation can also be a challenge. Sometimes, businesses find it difficult to identify the best ideas for new products or services and implement them successfully. This can lead to disappointment and even failure.
One way to overcome this challenge is by taking advantage of innovative technologies. Technologies that allow businesses to quickly create new products or services are often more successful than those that require more thought or effort. For example, online tools that help businesses track customer data are often more popular than those that involve physical visits or surveys.

Banks, insurance companies and other large organizations have used online tools for years in order to keep track of their customers’ spending habits and investments.
