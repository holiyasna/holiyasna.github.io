Futures of technology
What do you think the future holds for technology? Some believe that it will continue to evolve and grow, while others predict that it will become more advanced and complex. Either way, there are a number of ideas that could be explored in order to further advance this field. Here are some possible scenarios:
1) In 2022, we may see advances in 3D printing technology that allow for objects to be created from multiple layers of plastic or other materials. This would allow for a significant increase in the number of products that can be manufactured on a large scale, as well as faster and easier production times.

2) Another development that could impact our industry is the advent of artificial intelligence (AI). As machines get better at learning and responding to various challenges, they may become capable of performing tasks that were once considered impossible or too difficult for humans to perform.

Invention history: How did some inventions become successful?
Invention history is a long and flexible way to describe the process of creating something new. From the early days of mankind, when people were just starting to learn how to make things, Invention has always been an important part of human life. Sometimes, an idea can be very simple, and other times it may be more complex. But in both cases, it can bring about a lot of change and improvement for those who come up with it. Here are some examples of inventions that have made a big difference in the world:
1. The Telephone: This invention was actually two separate ideas – one by Alexander Graham Bell and the other by Samuel Morse. Both men were working on different projects at the time, but they came up with a working prototype together. In 1876, they announced their findings to the public and quickly became famous for their work.
