What are big ideas?
Big ideas are important, but they can be hard to come by. Here are some tips on finding big ideas that will help you succeed: 
1. Define what you want your business to achieve. Once you have a clear idea of what your business wants to accomplish, it's easier to come up with ideas for how to achieve it. 
2. Think about who your target market is. Big businesses often think about their target market as all the people who are potential customers or employees who might be interested in their product or service. However, there are also many people out there who don't have a specific interest in your product or service, and you need to include them in your thinking while developing your big idea. 
3. Create a vision and mission statement.

The role of innovation in business:
Innovation is essential to businesses in today's competitive environment. By constantly developing new products and services, businesses can stay ahead of the curve and remain competitive. However, there are a few key challenges that must be overcome in order for businesses to continue to innovate:1) It can be difficult to predict what will work and what won't in the market; 2) Some ideas may not be viable based on the company's current resources or past experience; 3) The novelty of a new product may wear off after a short period of time; 4) There may be some initial costs associated with innovation which can impact business margins; 5) Innovation often requires time and effort - particularly during the early stages of development; 6) Some aspects of innovation, such as customer service, may not match traditional expectations.
