The Creative Process: How do you come up with creative ideas?
Creative ideas come to us in all shapes and forms. Sometimes they are just a flash of inspiration, and other times they take more time to form. Regardless of how you come up with them, the process is the same: you need to be able to brainstorm, generate fresh ideas, and test them out. This is where creativity comes in – it can help you get your original ideas off the ground and into action.

How to get started with big ideas?
If you're looking to start making big ideas, one of the best ways to do it is by learning how to brainstorm. A lot can be gained from practicing brainstorming, especially if you want to come up with ideas for projects or products that are both new and innovative. Here are a few tips on how to get started: 
1. Make a list of key ideas 
This is probably the most important step in brainstorming, as it will help you determine which ones you should keep in mind for further consideration. Once you have a few key ideas, it's time to begin working on developing them into full-blown concepts. 
2. Take some time for yourself 
When brainstorming, it's important not to spend too much time just thinking about what other people might think or feel about your idea.

Invention ideas can be as simple as a new product or as complex as a new way to do an old thing. Whatever the invention, there are a few things that must be true in order for it to be called an invention. First, the invention must be novel and not already in use. Second, the invention must be useful, and third, the innovation must improve upon an existing product or method.
