Conclusion: How can you use brainstroming to boost your productivity and overall success?
A lot has been said about the power of brainstroming, and it is no wonder that the practice is now being used more and more to improve productivity. The key is to find a way to use brainstroming in ways that benefit both you and your business. Here are four ways: 
1. Brainstorm potential solutions to problems. When brainstorming, always come up with as many possible solutions as possible so that you can see which one might be best for your situation. This will help you stay focused while you work and avoid duplication of efforts. 
2. Use brainstroming to improve communication between team members. When brainstorming, it can be helpful to have everyone in the same room so that everyone can see what is being considered. This will help them understand each other better and make better decisions.
