How did invention ideas come about?
Invention ideas come about when two people think of the same idea and come up with a plan to make it a reality. Invention ideas can come from anywhere, but often they start with an idea that someone has had before. Sometimes an idea is just too good to be true, but often the realisation that it could be used in a product or service makes it all the more appealing. For example, there was once a man who came up with the idea for a computer game called "Pac-Man". This game would help children learn about mathematics and science, something that was sorely lacking in their schools at the time. Another example is the invention of the telephone. Many people at first thought it couldn't be used because it was so big and expensive, but soon realised that it could be turned into a valuable tool for communication.

What are the benefits of having ideas?
When it comes to ideas, there are many benefits to having them. Ideas can help solve problems, provide new perspectives, and even change the course of history. Here are five ways in which ideas can benefit individuals and organizations: 
1. Ideas can help people think differently. When people have different ideas about a problem or issue, they can come up with more solutions than if they were just following the same path. By sharing their own perspectives and thoughts, people can form better plans and strategies for solving problems. 
2. Ideas can help organizations grow. One of the best things about having ideas is that they give organizations a range of options for new products, services, or directions. This allows businesses to explore different paths and figure out what works best for them while also staying afloat in a changing market landscape.
