Style: How to write effectively?
It is easy to become bogged down in the details of writing style when you're just starting out. However, by following a few simple tips, you can improve your writing style and make your work more effective. Here are five tips:
1. Use active voice
When you write, use active voice to describe what's happening in the story. This will make the reader feel like they are on the scene, rather than reading a report from someone else.

2. Use clear and concise language
 clarity is key when it comes to writing. Make sure your words are easy to read and understand. And don't forget to use proper grammar!

3. Use concrete examples    When you're talking about something specific, use concrete examples instead of jargon or metaphors. This will help readers see what you're trying to say in a clear way.

Commercialization: How can inventors develop their inventions into successful businesses?
There are a variety of ways to turn inventions into successful businesses, depending on the inventor and the business opportunity. 
One way is for an inventor to commercialize their invention. This can be done through a variety of ways, including selling the invention to a company, licensing the invention, or working with a business to help develop new products or services. 

Another way is for an inventor to work on their invention full time and then sell their product when it becomes available. This is an option if the inventor has a strong idea for a product or service that they believe could be successful. However, it can be difficult to make money from an invention this way. 
The third way is for an inventor to find someone who has an existing product or service that they could use as a model for their own product.
