What are some common mistakes people make when starting a blog?
There are a few common mistakes people make when starting a blog, and the most important thing is to be aware of them so that you don’t make them. Here are some mistakes to watch out for:

But if you don’t really know what you want your blog to achieve, then it will likely fail.

2. Not having a clear strategy for growth. One of the best ways to ensure that your blog does well is to have a solid strategy for growing it over time.

The Benefits of Thinking Out Loud: How to get started
With so many things going on in our lives, it can be difficult to focus. It's easy to forget that we have the power to think and change the world. Here are a few ideas to get you started:

2) Take action. Sometimes all it takes is taking some action towards your objective- even if it's just writing down what you plan to do next. This will help keep you motivated as well as give yourself an idea of how far you've come already. 
3)「What if?」 Thinking about possibilities can help increase your confidence when making decisions.
