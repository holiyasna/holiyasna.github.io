what are creative ideas?
A creative idea is an original thought or concept that has the potential to be developed into something tangible. It is often associated with innovation and creativity, and is often driven by a need or desire to solve a problem.
There are many ways to generate creative ideas, but some common methods include brainstorming, mind mapping, and using lateral thinking techniques. Once an idea has been generated, it is often important to incubate it, or let it percolate for a while before taking action on it. This can help to ensure that the idea is fully formed and that all potential avenues have been explored.

While there is no one guaranteed formula for generating creative ideas, there are certain things that can help to foster an environment where they are more likely to occur.

The Challenge of Innovation: How do we ensure that innovations are successful?
Innovation has always been a challenge. What makes it so difficult is that it often hinges on the right decisions and the right team. Today, with advancements in technology, innovation is even more important. Here are three challenges that need to be overcome if innovation is to succeed:
1. The Myth of the One True Idea
 knapsackers faced a similar challenge when they sought ways to improve their productivity. “There was only one way to do it, and that was by following the recipe,” says Allen Weinberg, MIT mathematician and co-author of The Art of Computer Programming. Even today, some companies continue this paradigm by insisting on using only one approach for every product or service. This limits creativity and variety in the marketplace, which can lead to success or failure in innovation.
