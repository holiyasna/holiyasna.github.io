Creativity and professionalism: How do you use creativity in your job?
Creativity and professionalism are two important aspects of any job. If you want to be a successful artist, you need to be able to come up with creative ideas. If you want to be a professional doctor, you also need to be able to come up with innovative ways to help patients. In both cases, creativity and professionalism are essential.
If you want your work to look professional, you need to use creativity as often as possible.
