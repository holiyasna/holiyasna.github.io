They help to ensure that innovations are brought to market quickly, and that companies can continue to make new products and technologies for future generations. Patenting a new technology also helps to protect the intellectual property of creators, ensuring that their ideas are protected long after they expire.

The power of big ideas
Big ideas are what drive innovation, creativity and success. They are the seeds of new thoughts and ideas that can change the course of a company or individual. Here, we explore four powerful ways to get big ideas in your head:
1. Get inspired by others: Take a look around you and see how others are able to come up with amazing solutions or new ideas. What do they do that you can't? Why did they do it that way and what were their results?

2. Adopt a principle: There's no need to be unique if you have a principle at the heart of your idea. Look for someone who has already done something great on this topic and copy their approach/methodology/mesurement/whatever it is.

The Idea: 1. What are some big ideas?
There are a few big ideas out there when it comes to starting a business. Here are some of the most prominent:
1. Start small and grow large. This is one of the most important things to remember when starting a business. You don't have to be the biggest or best in the world just start something and see where it takes you.
2. Be passionate about what you do. If you're not passionate about your work, no one else will be either. This is something that will come with time and experience, but start off by putting your all into your startup and showing people that you're really into it.
3. Have repeat customers/clients come back for more.
