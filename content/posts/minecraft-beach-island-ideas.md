The creative process
The creative process is a journey that can be both exciting and challenging. It is a process that requires both left brain and right brain thinking. The left brain is responsible for logical, linear, and sequential thinking. The right brain is responsible for more creative, intuitive, and nonlinear thinking.
The creative process often begins with an idea or a problem that needs to be solved. The first step is to gather information about the problem or the challenge at hand. Once the information has been gathered, it is time to start generating ideas. This is where the left brain and the right brain need to work together. The left brain will come up with logical solutions while the right brain will come up with more creative solutions.

Once ideas have been generated, it is time to start narrowing down the options. This step requires both critical thinking and creativity.
