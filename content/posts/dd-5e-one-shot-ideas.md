Conclusion: What are some potential applications of brainstroming?
Brainstroming is a type of meditation that has been found to have many potential applications. In one study, participants were asked to focus on a specific object for 3 minutes. After the 3 minutes had passed, they were given a letter grade based on how much attention they had paid to the object throughout the session. The study found that those who had practiced brainstroming were more likely to receive an A than those who did not. Another study found that brainstroming was able to improve working memory in younger adults. It was also shown that practicing brainstroming improved mood and cognitive performance.

What new trends will we see in technology in 2022?
1. In 2022, we will see a continued trend of technology that is more artificial intelligence-driven and able to learn on its own. This will allow machines to do things that humans would have traditionally considered difficult or impossible, such as understanding natural language and pattern recognition.
2. We also expect to see a continued move in the field of virtual reality, which has been growing in popularity in recent years due to its ability to immerses users into another world where they can experience the same sensations as if they were there. This technology could be used for training new employees or salespeople, or even for entertainment purposes.

3. Another trend we can expect to see in 2022 is the growth of self-driving cars, which are becoming increasingly popular due to their safety and efficiency features.

getting feedback: How do you get feedback for your creative ideas?
Creative ideas are a great way to get feedback for your work. However, getting feedback can be difficult. There are a number of ways to get feedback and it depends on the person you are talking to. Here are some tips:
1. Take notes when you have thoughts or ideas. This will help you remember what you want to say later and also give you feedback on how your idea is sounding.

2. Get someone else to listen to your ideas. If you only have yourself to talk to, it can be tough getting feedback because it may not be clear what is wanted from the conversation. Get someone else who will understand the idea and can give feedback that is helpful.

3. Talk about your ideas with others before starting anything new.
