What is a quality idea?
Quality is a key word in any business, and when it comes to ideas, it’s no different. Quality ideas are ones that can be improved upon and that could lead to increased profits for the business. Here are four ways to create quality ideas:
1. Develop a unique selling proposition (USP) for your business. This is the main thing that will differentiate your product or service from those of your competitors. It should be clear, concise, and easy to understand for customers who are looking for something new and different.

2. Offer discounts or special deals on your products or services. This will entice customers to come into your store or office and buy what you have to offer. It also helps keep customers around longer since they know that you’ll be offering something of value in return for their money.

Conclusion: What are the implications of innovation for business?
Invention has been the backbone of business for centuries. When something is new, businesses can capitalize on it to increase sales and create new products or services. However, recent innovations have created new challenges for businesses as they try to keep up with the technology. For example, Apple's iPhone has made phone texting and talking on the go a must-have feature for many people. However, this has also led to increased competition in the market as text messaging companies such as WhatsApp and Viber offer better rates and features for their users. Additionally, Google's Chromebook computer is revolutionizing educational resources by making them more accessible online. These are just a few examples of how innovation can impact businesses in different ways.

What is innovation and how does it differ from other types of creativity?
Innovation is a process of creating new ideas or products that solve a problem. It can come in many forms- from the invention of the telephone to the development of new drugs. 
One important difference between innovation and creativity is that innovation typically involves more than one person. In order to create something new, you need to come up with a solution that meets the needs of your audience and is unique to them. On the other hand, creativity often comes from within- people working on their own projects without any outside help. This type of creativity often produces more original ideas and products than those developed in collaboration.
