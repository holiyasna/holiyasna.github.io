5. External Review and recommendation: How do you get feedback from others about your idea?
When you're developing a new idea, it's important to get feedback from others who can provide valuable insights. But how do you get feedback from those who are not your direct contemporaries or even friends? There are a few ways to get feedback, but the most effective way is through an external review and recommendation. External reviews can help assess whether your idea is worth pursuing and, if so, whether there are any potential roadblocks that need to be addressed.
