Stimulating creativity with prompts:
When it comes to creativity, there are a variety of ways to get those ideas flowing. One way is to use prompts. Prompts can help to stimulate the creative process by providing a structure or framework within which to generate ideas.
There are a number of different types of prompts that can be used, depending on what you’re looking to achieve. For example, if you’re looking for ideas for a new project, you might use a prompt that asks you to come up with three possible options for what that project could be.

If you’re struggling with writer’s block, on the other hand, you might use a prompt that gives you a specific topic or scenario to write about. The key is to find a prompt that works for you and your current needs.
