2020: The United States and China’s new relationship
As the world's two biggest economies start to elbow each other in 2020, it is important to ask what their new relationship will be. What are the key topics of discussion? What challenges does 2020 bring for the two countries? And is there anything in common between them that could help make their relationship stronger?

Invention Ideas: What are they, and why are they so popular?
Inventions are a dime a dozen, but the ones that get people thinking and making new ideas are the ones that are popular.

Differential value for art: What matters to individuals?
Creative art is one of the most subjective things a person can have. Some people enjoy looking at intricate designs or exploring different colors and textures, while others find pieces with simple designs more compelling. There isn’t one right way to look at art, and it doesn’t matter what someone’s individual values are. The important thing is that someone enjoys creative art, regardless of their individual beliefs.
