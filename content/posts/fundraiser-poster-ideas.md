Creative process: From idea to finished product
Creative process is the process that goes behind the creation of any artwork. This can be anything from a simple idea to a masterpiece. There are many different steps that go into creating an artwork, and it can be difficult to determine which one is responsible for the finished product. However, some key steps in the creative process include:
1. Brainstorming: Brainstorming is when you come up with ideas for art and discuss them with others. This helps you come up with new ideas and ways to improve upon old ones.

2. coming up with details: Once you have brainstormed, it’s important to start coming up with specific ideas for your work. This includes making sure your images are clear, considering how your work will be displayed, and figuring out what type of paper or canvas you’ll need to create your artwork on.
