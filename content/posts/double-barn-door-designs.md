Inventors and their ideas
Invention is the backbone of progress. It has led to the creation of entire industries and propelled humanity forward. But what drives someone to become an inventor?
For most people, it starts with a problem that they want to solve. They see something that doesn't work the way it should or could be improved, and they set out to create a solution. In some cases, the invention is born out of necessity; in others, it's simply a matter of wanting to make something better.

Whatever the motivation, all great inventions start with an idea. And behind every great idea is an inventive mind at work.
