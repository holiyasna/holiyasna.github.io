How to Make Your Home More Functional
Last year, I was faced with a unique challenge. My home was slowly being used less and less as my office became more and more. To keep up with the trend, I decided to create a few key functional pieces in my home that could help me get more done. Here are some tips on how to make your home more functional: 
1. Make an organized space - One of the most important things you can do to improve your productivity is make sure you have an organized space in which to work. This can be anything from a shelves of books on one side of the room to wires leading out of the windows for potential cable management purposes. 

2. Get rid of distractions - When it comes to working, it’s important to keep things as quiet and distraction-free as possible.
