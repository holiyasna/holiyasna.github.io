The five types of brainstorming: open, collaborative, focused, problem-solving, and creative.
Brainstorming is one of the most essential skills for any business or professional. It can be used for creative problem solving, brainstorming for ideas for products and services, and more. However, not all brainstorming sessions are created equal. Here are five different types of brainstorming that can help improve your session productivity: 
1. Open brainstorming: This type of brainstorming is usually used when there is no specific goal to achieve or when everyone is free to come and go as they please. In this type of session, everyone is given a set amount of time to come up with ideas and then those ideas are prioritized based on how important they think they are.

2. Collaborative brainstorming: This type of brainstorming helps teams work together towards a common goal.

The Benefits of Creative Ideas: After hearing all of the benefits of creative ideas, it is clear why they are so important in business.
Creative ideas are important in business because they can help businesses create new and innovative products or services. Some of the benefits of creative ideas include: 
1. Increased Productivity – When a business has a good idea, they can often improve their productivity as they can better focus on what they are supposed to be doing. 
2. Improved Delight at Work – While some businesses may find it difficult to come up with creative ideas, creative thinking often leads to increased delight and satisfaction with work. This is due in part to the fact that creativity opens up new possibilities and helps businesses explore the potential of their products or services in a more interesting way than if they were just following pre-determined paths.
