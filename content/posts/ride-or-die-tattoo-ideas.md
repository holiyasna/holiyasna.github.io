How to be creative: Tips and tricks.
1. Be open to new and different ideas. One way to become more creative is to expose yourself to new and different ideas. This can be done by reading, attending lectures or workshops, and talking with people who think differently than you do.
2. Take time to daydream. Another way to increase your creativity is to take some time each day to let your mind wander. This can be done by journaling, taking walks in nature, or simply sitting quietly and letting your thoughts come and go as they please.

3. Be persistent and don’t give up. It’s important to remember that not all of your ideas will be good ones, but don’t let that stop you from being creative. If you keep at it, eventually you will come up with something great!

Tips For New Artists
When it comes to new artists, there are a few key things that you can do in order to help them get started and get the most out of their work. First and foremost, be patient. New artists often have a lot of hard work ahead of them, and they need time in order to develop their skills. Additionally, make sure to keep a portfolio full of your latest pieces in order to show off your progress and give other artists a chance to see what you’re capable of. Finally, always be open to feedback. By giving feedback and receiving positive feedback, you can help new artists improve their work as well as grow as artists themselves.
