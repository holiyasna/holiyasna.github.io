How to brainstorm effectively.
1. When it comes to brainstorming, there are a few key things to keep in mind in order to make the process as effective as possible. 
2. First and foremost, it’s important to create a relaxed and comfortable environment for everyone involved. This means no judgment, no pressure, and no distractions. 
3. Once you have the right setting, it’s time to start generating ideas. The best way to do this is to encourage free-flowing thought and open-mindedness. 
4. Brainstorming sessions should be all about quantity over quality at first – worry about filtering and refining later on. 
5. It can be helpful to have someone act as a facilitator during the session, keeping things on track and making sure everyone has a chance to share their ideas.

How does brainstroming affect thinking?
Brainstroming is a type of self-talk that can have a significant impact on how people think. It's a type of mental practice that helps improve focus, problem solving, and decision making. Brainstroming can be effective when used in conjunction with other cognitive techniques, such as problem solving and critical thinking skills.
There are several types of brainstroming, including active and passive brainstroming. Active brainstroming is when someone engages in the practice themselves, while passive brainstroming occurs when they listen to or watch others do it. The goal of active brainstroming is to develop their own thought processes and ways of thinking. The goal of passive brainstroming is to provide support for others' thoughts so they can better process them.

What are some creative techniques?
Creative techniques can be anything from painting to sculpting to writing. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced artist, there are a number of creative techniques that can help you get the best results in your artwork. Here are three examples:
1. Use perspective to create depth and interest in your artwork. Perspective is important when it comes to creating images, so use it to great effect in your paintings and sculptures. By understanding how perspective works, you can exaggerate or avoid details that may not look as important on the surface.

2. Use light and shadow to create moods in your artwork. You can use light and dark tones to create moods in your work, or you can use them simply as means of adding atmosphere and character into your pieces. For example, if you want your artwork to feel suspenseful, try using light shadows against dark backgrounds.
