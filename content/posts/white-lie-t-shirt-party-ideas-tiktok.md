History of inventions: How have inventions been made over time?
Inventions have been made for centuries, but it is only recently that there has been a concerted effort to collect and study these inventions. Many of the most amazing and influential inventions have come about through collaboration between multiple individuals or teams. Here are four examples of how inventions have been made over time:

1) The telephone – This invention was first developed in 1876 by Alexander Graham Bell and his partner Samuel Morse. They designed a talking telephone which could be used to communicate with one another.

2) The electric light bulb – This invention was first developed in 1879 by George Stephenson and John Wise. They created a device that could be plugged into an electrical outlet and use electricity to produce light.

3) The air-purifier – This invention was first developed in 1919 by Maynard Kelleher and Clifford Berry.

Conclusion: Summarize the main points of the article.
Invention is the process of creating something new. It can be a new product, a new way of doing something, or a new process. Inventors are people who come up with new ideas and find ways to make them work.
The invention process generally includes four steps: coming up with the idea, developing the idea, testing the idea, and commercializing the idea. Inventors typically use their creativity and knowledge to come up with an initial idea. They then develop that idea by doing research, making prototypes, and testing their invention. Once they have a working prototype, they commercialize their invention by marketing it and selling it to consumers.

Inventions can be big or small. They can be life-changing or just make someone's life a little easier. But all inventions start with an idea.
