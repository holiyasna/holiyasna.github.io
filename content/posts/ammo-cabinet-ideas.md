Tools: How should you use the tools you have?
If you have a few tools that you like to use, it's important to know how to use them in order to get the most out of them. Here are four easy ways to use your tools the right way:
1) Make a toolset: When you have a few tools, it's better to make a toolset rather than purchase individual tools. This will save you time and money in the long run. A good starting point is an electronic toolkit, such as this one from Amazon. You can find other options here.

2) Use common sense: It's important not only to be able to use your tools but also be aware of what they do. If something doesn't work or doesn't seem right, try turning it around and using another tool instead.
